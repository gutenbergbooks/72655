</div>

<p>This book is a record of impressions gained from ten weeks
of travel through the theaters of France, Sweden, Germany,
Czecho-Slovakia, and Austria during April, May, and June,
1922. These impressions are partly reinforced, partly orientated,
through previous visits to Paris and London, and through
a long sojourn of Mr. Jones in Germany just before the war.</p>

<p>For the purposes of this book, the journey excluded England,
because observation and reliable report showed little there
that was not a faint echo of what was to be found on the
Continent. Russia was regretfully excluded for reasons of time
and the difficulties of travel; but fortunately we were able to
see in Stockholm a performance by the touring company of the
Moscow Art Theater. Though the most interesting evenings
of our trip were spent in the Redoutensaal in Vienna, and in
the Vieux-Colombier and the Cirque Medrano in Paris, the
larger part of our time was passed in Germany, and the greater
number of illustrations come from productions seen there. In
Berlin, in particular, there were things to be seen which had
been much discussed by American visitors—<em>Masse-Mensch</em>,
the Grosses Schauspielhaus, and the work of Leopold Jessner,—and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_viii">[Pg viii]</span> 
these, we felt, demanded lengthy study and analysis.</p>

<p>In our ten weeks Mr. Jones and I saw close to sixty performances.
We had expected to find it difficult, if not impossible,
to see in this time as much as we should have liked of the really
significant new work of the Continental theater. But, as it
happened, good fortune and the great courtesy shown us everywhere
enabled us to see almost everything that we wished.
Through special performances arranged by the managements
of the Royal Swedish Opera and the Berlin Volksbühne, and
by Jacques Copeau, director of the Vieux-Colombier, we saw
half a dozen most important productions which we might otherwise
have missed. Luck and the repertory system found us at
various German theaters in time to witness the most characteristic
and significant work of the past few years. Finally, we
were fortunate enough to come upon two theaters—one accomplished,
the other potential—of extraordinary interest
and importance, which had not as yet been seen or discussed
by American visitors, the Redoutensaal in Vienna and the
Cirque Medrano in Paris. <em>Continental Stagecraft</em> cannot
pretend to be so exhaustive a study as a year’s visit would have
made possible, but, in view of the exceptional circumstances, I
think that it is more than proportionately representative.</p>

<p>With the exception of one sketch of a supposititious production
in the Cirque Medrano, the illustrations show exactly what
we saw and nothing else. Mr. Jones’s drawings are in themselves<span class="pagenum" id="Page_ix">[Pg ix]</span>
a kind of criticism which the modern theater stands much
in need of. They give the actual visual quality of the best productions
on the Continental stage far better than could photographs
of settings and actors, which are usually flashlights
innocent of the atmosphere produced by the stage lighting, or
the designs of the scenic artists, which are sometimes imperfectly
realized and sometimes bettered in actual production.
Mr. Jones made his drawings as soon as might be after the
performance, working from many rough notes made during
the progress of the play. They are, I believe, uncommonly
true to the impression gained by the audience. My only reservation
would be that they catch the scene and the lighting always
at the best moment, and, through the quality of the drawing,
they sometimes add a beauty that is perhaps a little flattering
to the original.</p>

<p>The text is a collaboration in ideas, though not, with the
exception of the captions under the pictures, in writing. It is a
compilation of our impressions, reactions, and conclusions. Because
the words are my own, I have taken the liberty of the
personal pronoun “I” when “we” would be editorially pompous
or inexact.</p>

<p>The book began as an attempt to supplement the International
Theater Exhibition held in Amsterdam and London
during the first half of 1922. This large, varied, and arresting
collection of sketches and models showed the art of the theater<span class="pagenum" id="Page_x">[Pg x]</span>
largely as it existed in the imaginations of the stage designers.
Many of these sketches were for productions never made, some
had been greatly altered for better or for worse in the course of
production. It was our feeling that we might be able to add
something to the knowledge which this important exhibition
was spreading abroad if we could make some record, however
incomplete, of the actual accomplishment of the artists upon
the stage, and particularly of the directors and actors, who,
after all, have the major share in the art of the theater.</p>

<p>We have seen so much that is interesting, so much that is significant,
and a few things so stimulating and inspiriting, that
we have been tempted often to push our report of impressions
into an anticipation of future progress. We have, I fear, substituted
our own imaginations in many places for those of the
artists of the International Exhibition.</p>

BEYOND REALISM</h2>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">It</span> is a pity to begin a book by being dull. But a time of
change is upon us in the theater, and a time of change is a
time for definitions.</p>

<p>We have passed through such times before, and we have
come out after some years—a century or so—with categories
neatly fixed. We can look back along the history of English
literature and place a judicial finger there and there and there
and say Middle English, Classicism, Romanticism. All this is
pretty well set. Then we come to Realism and its quagmires—quagmires
of balked creation and quagmires of discussion—and
we wallow about gesticulating and shouting and splashing
the mud into our immortal eyes. What is this bog we
have been so busy in? And what is the fitful and rather
blinding storm of illumination which plays about the horizon
and calls itself Expressionism?</p>

<p>Of course these things are just what we care to make them.
Various parties to the argument choose various definitions—the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</span>
kinds that suit their themes. I claim no more for mine
than that they will make clear what I am talking about, and
save a certain amount of futile dispute.</p>

<p>There are plenty of sources of confusion in discussions about
art. To begin with, it is not an easy thing to limit a dynamic
organism by definition. Creative efforts in drama, fiction or
painting run out of one category and into another with distressing
ease. More than that, there are apt to be many parts
to a whole, many divisions to a category; and the parts or
the divisions can be extraordinarily different. Finally, fanatics
and tea-table gossips are equally unscrupulous when it comes
to “proving” a point. They make the definitions of friends
and foes mean what they like. They take the part for the
whole, the division for the category. They pin down a lively
and meandering work of art at just the place where they
want it. Two disputants, bent on exhibiting the more indecent
side of human intelligence, can make the twilight of
discussion into a pit of black confusion.</p>

<p>Let us bring the thing down to the present quarrel in the
theater: the quarrel with Realism, which has moments of
clarity; the quarrel with Expressionism, which is murky as
hell.</p>

<p>What are we going to mean when we talk about Realism?
So far as this book goes, the word Realism means a way of
looking at life which came into vogue about fifty years ago.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</span>
It sees truth as representation. It demands a more or less literal
picture of people and happenings. It insists that human beings
upon the stage shall say or do only those things that are reasonably
plausible in life. Resemblance is not always its end, but
resemblance is a test that must be satisfied before any other
quality may be admitted. Realism is not, of course, a matter
of trousers, silk hats, and machinery. The realistic attitude
can invade the sixteenth century, as it does in Hauptmann’s
<em>Florian Geyer</em>. Trousers, silk hats, and machinery can be the
properties of a non-realistic play like O’Neill’s <em>The Hairy
Ape</em>. The test of Realism, as the term is here employed, is
the test of plausibility: Would men and women talk in this
fashion in real life under the conditions of time, place, and
action supplied by the playwright? It is the business of the
realistic playwright to draw as much as possible of inner truth
to the surface without distorting the resemblance to actuality.</p>

<p>There should not be a great deal to quarrel about in such a
definition of Realism, though its adherents may deny hotly
the natural assertion that the method of Realism is barren
either in whole or in part. At any rate, people generally understand
what the row is about, and the disputants can kick up only
about so much dust on this battle-field. Non-realism is another
matter.</p>

<p>That the thing is the opposite of Realism is obvious in just
one respect: It does not admit the test of resemblance. It denies<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</span>
in the theater, as furiously as do the works of Cézanne or Picasso
in the picture gallery, the validity of representation. But what
will it substitute for the technique of Realism and what will it
call the substitute? It will go back to romantic periods for a
free technique, but it will look forward for its materials along
paths which psychological research has lately opened to men
and women outside the ranks of true poetic genius. By this it
may arrive at the inner truth of Shelley and Goethe, Shakespeare
and Æschylus, while it sacrifices the outer truth of Ibsen
and Bataille, Pinero and Galsworthy. The question is both of
technique and of materials, for an inner truth is to be found in
a study of the unconscious mind which will not brook the obstructions
of actuality and resemblance. Inner truth is so
much more important than actuality that the new type of
drama will not bother itself to achieve both, and if one must
infringe on the other—which must happen in almost every
case—then it chooses quickly and fearlessly the inner truth.</p>

<p>To give this anti-Realism a name involves confusions dear
to the heart of the controversialist. To give it the name Expressionism
multiplies these confusions. Yet it is hard to see
any alternative at the moment. We must embrace the name—and
the confusions.</p>

<p>The chief confusion is due to the fact that there are two
kinds of Expressionism, as there are doubtless two kinds of
Realism. There is the larger and there is the smaller. Realism<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</span>
can be a mere technique—resemblance; and it can also be
a resemblance through which you catch a vision of the soul.
Expressionism can be seen by the friends of Realism only as
the narrow, neurotic, violent, and formless art which displays
itself in the dramas of the new German writers like Georg
Kaiser. I should be prepared to defend this sort of Expressionism
against the Realism of Augustus Thomas or even of
John Galsworthy; but I should not admit that it was the end
of the reaction against resemblance. Expressionism may be
applied—and for the purposes of this book it shall be applied—to
the whole tendency against Realism, just as Romanticism
is applied to the whole tendency against Classicism.
Many who dislike Realism and neurotic German Expressionism
equally, prefer to give the form they seek some such well-worn
and inoffensive label as Poetry. This finickiness doesn’t
matter—except as it admits new confusions and dodges the
issue. This issue is plain and should be kept plain. Realism,
in any but a very extraordinary sense, is a cramp upon art. Instinctively
artists of the theater are beginning to recognize this
and to seek some way out. This involves new qualities in the
play. For practical purposes let us call the way of escape
Expressionism. Some other term may establish itself in the
course of years, but for the moment this is all we have.</p>

<p>It is fairly easy to apply these terms and definitions to the
current theater—if you are not too doctrinaire or too partizan.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</span>
Realism yawningly enfolds ninety-nine out of a hundred playwrights.
Maeterlinck and D’Annunzio require a little special
attention and Shaw and Barrie raise nice points. But, in general,
the distinction holds; resemblance shepherds the realistic
plays, emanations of the unconscious guide us to the expressionistic.
Even the purely representational performances
which most of our actors and directors give do not always succeed
in hiding the cleavage.</p>

<p>The most startling and disturbing experience that any friend
of Expressionism can have is to sit through a performance of
Tchehoff’s <em>The Cherry Orchard</em> by the Moscow Art Theater—even
by that portion of Stanislavsky’s celebrated company
which was cut off by Wrangel’s army while playing in Southern
Russia and compelled to tour Europe for two years before
repatriation was possible. Here is a play of a generation ago
written by the man whose dramas were the cornerstone of success
for the world’s greatest realistic theater. It is a <em>genre</em>
study almost without plot: decayed aristocrats, old servants,
newly-rich peasants and the incident of the sale for debt of an
ancestral property. There is no more violence in it than the
violence of life which rots an oak. There is no more distortion
than is to be expected in light reflected from the troubled surface
of life. And it is played with an almost utter perfection
of realistic detail, complete impersonation, and rounded ensemble.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</span></p>

<p>Yet if this is Realism we have never known Realism in our
theater. It carries us through life and out on the other side.
It drenches us with a mystic sense of existence. And when we
read the text of the play and separate it from the extraordinary
emotional actuality of the performance, we discover again and
again and again speech that drives straight at free expression
instead of resemblance, and action and character permeated
with an almost religious symbolism. All this fused by playwright
and players into what seems a work of the most perfect
resemblance, but what is actually only the appearance of appearance.</p>

<p>The surface of the play is the surface of life. Mme.
Ranevsky has returned to her estates after a turmoil of years in
France. There are the usual appendages: a daughter, an
adopted daughter, a governess, a housemaid, a major-domo,
and a man-servant who have grown into the life of the house,
a brother, an old, impoverished friend, a village clerk with his
eye on the maid-servant, an up-and-coming merchant whose
grandfather was a serf on the estate. These people talk a great
deal, and in talking they make certain matters plain. One of
these is that no one can save the estate, the beautiful cherry
orchard, from the consequences of the family temperament.
Madame and her brother have always spent their money as becomes
gentlefolk, and some one has forgotten the secret of how
the cherries used to be dried and sent to the markets of the far<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</span>
cities every year. They flounder about in self-deception, always
hoping for succor, never willing to accept the scheme of the
friendly merchant for cutting the estate up into villa lots, and
never able to do anything themselves to save it from the auctioneer.
Ultimately the merchant buys it in, and in blissful
callousness puts the ax to the trees as the family leave the old
house. Out of these people and their dilemma rises the most
curious and moving symbolism. A suggestion of symbols,
rather; for there is nothing bald about it. Truths of Russian
temperament, even Russian politics, are figured with the hidden
yet revealing quality that so often rises out of life like an odor
from old fields, freighted with memories and anticipations.
Perhaps the simplest and most moving example of this comes
at the very end of the play. Through it all has moved a mumbling,
bent old man who has been the loving guardian of the
household for two generations, one of those rare and ancient
servants who, by sheer servility, have lifted themselves out of
servantage and into a share in the family life. In the end, the
house is sold, the furniture removed, the shutters closed. The
family depart. Then into the dim room comes the old man,
forgotten. He totters across to the derelict sofa that has been
left behind. He curls up on it like some old leaf. There in
the darkness he dies. The soul of old Russia.</p>

<p class="no-indent">Realistic production at its best. The final moment
of Tchehoff’s <em>The Cherry Orchard</em> as produced
by the touring company of the Moscow Art
Theatre. The ancestral house has been sold, curtains
and pictures have been taken down, the furniture
is shrouded. The shutters are closed. The lights
are so dim that the room is no longer a room but
a vague, brooding presence. The old servant
gropes his way through the darkness, crawls upon
the couch and dies.</p>
</div>
</figcaption>
</figure>
<br>

<p>As the old man dies something occurs that gives us all the
license we need in order to see in other portions of the play
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</span>methods and attitudes far indeed from Realism. The stage
directions read: “A distant sound is heard, as if from the sky,
and the sound of a string breaking, dying away, melancholy.”
It is a sound that occurs also in the second act, unexplained,
ominous. Symbolism. Arbitrary and very expressive sounds
from heaven. Is it at all surprising to find the characters of
this play indulging in lengthy accounts of their lives without
taking the least trouble to find some stranger who might plausibly
be ignorant of it all?</p>

<p>Perhaps this is Realism, perhaps not. Certainly it is both
sharp with actuality and mystic with life’s intensity as these
Russian players act it. The company did not contain the greatest
of the group which Stanislavsky has gathered about him
since he opened his theater in 1897. The director himself was
not there to play the maundering brother. On this night Kachaloff
was out of the cast. But Mme. Knipper, the widow of
Tchehoff, played Mme. Ranevsky, and P. A. Pavloff played
the old servant. How many of the other players acted parts
long familiar to them I cannot say; but their work gave the
impression not only of exceptionally fine individual performances
but of an ensemble long and lovingly built up into perfection.
It is an old <em>cliché</em> as well as a sad comment on acting
as an art to say that a player does not <em>play</em> a character but literally
<em>is</em> the character. In the case of this company from the
Moscow Art Theater, there is a deep intensity in the performance<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</span>
and a frank desire for absolute impersonation which make
such a comment on their playing of <em>The Cherry Orchard</em> the
obvious and revealing truth. It is a comment that applies to
the ensemble as much as to the individual acting.</p>

<p>The wedding of an utterly realistic performance with a play
of mystic overtones is justified by the sense of an old and complete
life which both possess. The intimacy of the actors with
one another is as evident as the intimacy of the characters they
play, and the intimacy of masters and servants in this Russian
family. The welcome of the mistress on her return may be a
matter of the clever rehearsal of off-stage noise—amazingly
clever, you can believe; but when this adoration comes out of
the wings and walks upon the stage, it is seen as the perfection
of emotion and impersonation. A performance in so foreign a
tongue as Russian gains because our eager imagination is at work
to interpret in the acting the gaps left by the lack of words.
It also loses, because the meaning of the play is not always there
to show the linking of character and character, and of incident
and incident; great spaces of action are blank and without emotion;
we carry away fewer and shorter memories. How many
and how continuous, however, are the memories of this performance,
and how piercingly keen are the sharpest of them!
Mme Knipper: a welling flood of emotion at the old nursery
of her childhood; blind affection for the lovely, ancient
orchard; childlike prodigality in her gesture as she scatters<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</span>
money that might once have saved the estate, followed by childlike
penitence; and then the moment when she hears at last
that the orchard is sold, when her ability to ignore and forget
slips from her and she turns old before our eyes. Pavloff,
prince of impersonators of old men, hobbling about the room;
a bent and shuffling figure eternally mumbling, eternally nursing;
a watery-eyed kiss for madame’s hand, a pat for the twisted
collar of the brother, a touch to the turn of a curtain; an old,
old, devoted shape speaking its fullness of character in every
movement. Other figures almost as fully felt and seen. Each
one doing the least little thing with an arresting significance.
Here for once are actors who realize the importance of crossing
a stage, as a display not of themselves but of their characters.
Here, equally, are actors who have got by all the small
egoisms of their kind. It is said that Stanislavsky found his
players among artists, writers, students, shopkeepers, anywhere
but in “the profession.” At any rate in twenty years he has
made them into selfless but distinguished parts of a new organism.
Their intimacy as people must be as great as the intimacy
which they give their characters on the stage. They are an
orchestra; their playing is a music, a harmony. They seem to
have lived into this play in the eighteen years that they have
given it until now they are part one of another. It does not
matter that some may have had their rôles only five years, perhaps
only five months. They are enveloped in the mother-liquor<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</span>
of this mature, well-aged performance. You recall the
stew that Anatole France described: “To be good it must have
been cooking lengthily upon a gentle fire. Clemence’s stew
has been cooking for twenty years. She puts into the pot sometimes
goose or bacon, sometimes sausage or beans, but it is
always the same stew. The foundation endures; this ancient
and precious foundation gives the stew the quality that in the
pictures of old Venetian masters you find in the women’s
flesh.”</p>

<p>Such Realism as this of the Moscow Art Theater compares
most curiously with the best we know of realistic acting in the
productions of David Belasco and Arthur Hopkins. It has the
care and minutiæ of Belasco sharpened by far greater ability on
the part of players and director, and mellowed by time. It has
the naturalness of Hopkins; but, because it is secured by deliberate
direction and not by the indirection of the American’s
method, the naturalness fits into a general design and is never
slipshod. (So far Stanislavsky denies life and its accidents!)
It is, of course, worse than futile to compare such acting with
our own for any purpose but understanding. We cannot
achieve a performance of this kind so long as we have no
permanent companies, no repertory system. It is not alone a
matter of the leisurely method of production which Stanislavsky
can employ,—months spent in study of the script, long
readings and discussions over every character. Repertory<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</span>
keeps the actors playing a piece for years. They are not repeating
themselves evening after evening with mechanical devotion.
They come back to the play from other parts. They
see it anew. If it is such a piece as <em>The Cherry Orchard</em>, they
plunge into its depths with a sense of refreshment. They are
the parts of a whole which they can never greatly alter, but
which they can enrich by new contributions.</p>

<p>We have, then, in this performance an almost perfect example
of minute and thorough Realism, fused into something
beyond Realism through its union with a play distinctly expressionistic
in certain qualities. It would be easy to see how
frank, non-realistic acting could be applied to <em>The Cherry
Orchard</em>. It is, in fact, very hard to see how the players can
act some of the speeches as they do, notably the descriptions of
themselves and their lives which the governess and Madame
Ranevsky furnish to fellow-characters fully acquainted with
all they say, characters who very rightly pay not the slightest
heed. If ever a player had an opportunity to bridge directly
the gap which has existed between stage and audience for the
past fifty years, and to present emotion as simply and honestly
and theatrically as do the gravestones in Spoon River, it is the
actress who plays the governess. She begins the second act
with the following speech, virtually a soliloquy, to which none
of the others on the stage pay the least attention, even the attention
of boredom:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>I have no proper passport. I don’t know how old I am; I always
feel I am still young. When I was a little girl my father and mother
used to go about from one country fair to another, giving performances,
and very good ones, too. I used to do the <em>salto mortale</em> and all
sorts of tricks. When papa and mamma died, an old German lady
adopted me and educated me. Good! When I grew up I became a
governess. But where I come from and who I am I haven’t a notion.
Who my parents were—very likely they weren’t married—I don’t
know. I don’t know anything about it. I long to talk so, and I have
no one to talk to, I have no friends or relations.</p>
</div>

<p>Is this Realism? Is it Expressionism? Is it something between,
some Realism of the Spirit opposed to the Realism of
Flesh which we know? Can we say that we know true Realism
of the Flesh as yet? Even if we do know it in a few fugitive
productions, are we ready to give up not only such Realism
but also the possibility of deeply moving performances like
this of <em>The Cherry Orchard</em>, and to go seeking a fresh and
debatable thing far on the other side of experience? If we are,
it is because, we see that such perfection as this of <em>The Cherry
Orchard</em> is a very rare thing for which we pay with hours of
the commonplace, and because we recognize that when a play
reaches such spiritual quality it has traveled so far from Realism
that the journey is almost over.</p>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">There</span> is something in the nature of the theater that
makes Realism a natural and a thoroughly unsatisfactory
method of expression. Its principal material,
the actor, is too near actuality. It is no triumph of art to make
a flesh-and-blood man named Grant Mitchell into a flesh-and-blood
man named Andrew Lane. Especially when the heart
of the whole business is an elaborate pretense that there really
isn’t any actor, and there really isn’t any theater, and we are

<p>Obviously no other art is so close to life or so quick with
life’s vitality. Literature uses printed signs of a very arbitrary
and formal nature, which we translate into words forming ideas
and mental pictures, which, in turn, may suggest human beings
and their emotions. Music employs sounds some of which
faintly suggest bird-notes or the rumble of the heavens, but
none of which comes within shouting distance of the human
voice. Painting has pieces of canvas and lumps of colored
clays, and these it arranges in patterns, through which, by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</span>
custom and habit, we are able to gain an impression of a
curiously flattened life. Even sculpture, literal as its rounded,
three-dimensional shapes ordinarily are, must use the intermediary
of clay or rock. The theater is the one art that
works in the materials of life itself. It employs life to
render life. Painting, architecture, and sculpture may supply
a background to the actor, but the actor is the center of the
play, and when he speaks the words of literature he speaks
them as the actual human being from whom they are supposed
to come.</p>

<p>The actor brings the theater far too close to life to please
some of its great lovers. The actuality of the actor affrights
them. Gordon Craig, once an actor and always a true
partizan of the theater, has felt this. He has found the actor
too much a piece of life, too much a creature of the emotions
of existence, and too little an impersonal and dependable tool
of the artist. “The actions of the actor’s body, the expression
of his face, the sounds of his voice, all are at the mercy
of the winds of his emotions.” He is not clay, he is not stone,
he is not curves of ink, he is not arbitrary sounds produced
from wood or brass. He is life itself, and a very irregular
and undependable part of life. Therefore, says Craig, the
thing that the actor gives us is not a work of art; “it is a
series of accidental confessions.”</p>

<p>Now the contrast between the pliant and well-behaved<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</span>
clay and the intractable actor is interesting. And there is
a certain significance in the fact that when Craig describes
the work of the actor as a series of “accidental confessions,”
he uses a phrase which would delight the harshest of the
realists—the writers who practised Naturalism, the literal
transcription of the irregularities of life. But the issue goes
deeper. The actor is essential to the theater. He cannot
be turned out for a glorified puppet, an <em>Ubermarionette</em>.
But perhaps he can be told that he is far too near life and
its accidents to spend his time imitating them. To give us
life and its significance the dramatist, like workers in the
other arts, needs an intermediary. If the actor is not a true
intermediary, because he is a part of life, the dramatist has
only to see that he can go beyond the actuality of the physical
actor to Form. With the creative vitality of the living actor
to awaken us and make us sensitive and responsive, the dramatist
may strive to reach beyond outward truth to that inner
truth which presents itself to us in deliberate and natural
arrangements of life.</p>

<p>It is no easy thing to tell what is meant by the word Form
when we take it past the idea of the design of things in a
literal sense, and apply it to significance in the design of
life. But it is easy to say that Form has nothing whatever
to do with representation or illusion. As Clive Bell points
out in his book <em>Art</em>, in which he makes a brilliant plea for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</span>
what he calls “significant form” as the test of visual art,
the fact that a thing is representative, does not at all suggest
either the presence or the absence of Form. It does not
preclude its having Form just as it does not in the least
assure it. The theater will always have the physical body
of the actor, and to that extent it will always be representational.
But that is certainly all it need have of illusion. What
the actor says and the atmosphere in which he appears may
be absolutely non-representational. Even his physical body,
as he uses it, may take on qualities outside and beyond
illusion.</p>

<p>It remains the dramatist’s special business to master the
extremely difficult task of fighting through to Form while
retaining the realistic technique, or else—which seems far
better—frankly to desert Realism, representation, illusion,
and write directly in significant terms, no matter how unplausible
they may be. After all, common sense sees that it
is better to concentrate all of an artist’s technical energies on
the major thing he wishes to accomplish. Bell says of the
men and women of the future: “When they think of the
early twentieth-century painters they will think only of the
artists who tried to create Form—the artisans who tried to
create illusions will be forgotten.” It is equally true that
the artist who tries to create illusion is more than likely to
forget to create Form.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</span></p>

<p>Now creating Form does not mean hiding the actuality
of the actor under strange robes. There seems to be a curious
notion abroad that the alternative to Realism is Romance. It
is true that in trying to escape out of Realism a number of
playwrights have avoided reality and wandered into the
never-never-land of Thalanna and Kongros. It is also true
that modern sciences, history, archeology, and psychology,
have made the past new and real and alive again, and that
certain playwrights have seen in the rejuvenated ages a chance
to escape the realistic and to attain more permanent values.
But it is not true that the present offers smaller opportunities.
Expressionist playwrights have already shown this conclusively
enough; witness Eugene O’Neill’s <em>The Hairy Ape</em>.</p>

<p>Theatrical history has never been as popular with theatrical
reformers as it should be. It shows not only that the realistic
technique is a matter of the last half century, and that the
greatest periods of the theater’s history were non-realistic.
But it shows also that even when Realism was an impossible
idea, and when expressive, significant Form was the only
thing at which the playwright aimed, the theater and its audiences
usually lived frankly and healthfully in the present.</p>

<p>Greek tragedy, to be sure, was not a thing of the present—except
in the reality of its religious emotion. Its heroes
came out of the past. They did not talk or act like the
Athenians that watched them. They even dressed according<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</span>
to a set convention of their own. In every way the Greek
tragic theater embraced Form, directly and naturally. It
was in the temperament of the Greeks. Their sculpture was
realistic to a degree never before reached and not surpassed
in physical truth to-day; yet from these statues we gain a
sense of Form far more significant than the sense of life
which they give us. Representation was not an end to the
Greek artist. The dramatist of Athens felt no desire to
“humanize” his heroes or to make them like the people about
him in any particular. The drama was religious in origin
and had not yet grown temporal. So long as the Greek mind
had its fondness for Form, there could be no demand for
the smallest actuality.</p>

<p>But man’s natural fondness for “humanness” and “recognition”
found plenty of opportunity for expression after the
passing of the great Greeks. And it was satisfied in almost
every case without breaking in too sharply on the heart of
the drama, expression of Form. The medieval religious
drama was both religious and temporal. The saints were
very much of the times in clothes and in habits. The Bible
characters lived the lives and wore the garments and exercised
the minds of people of the Middle Ages. Shakespeare
dipped back into history and into romance, too, but his Italian
nobles dressed like Londoners, his Roman “mechanicals”
were British workmen, and his Athenian yokels came out of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</span>
the English countryside. Molière “modernized” the Roman
rascal Phormio into the Neapolitan rascal Scapin, and the
ordinary Parisian gentleman served him for Alceste. Phèdre
and Iphigénie were not so very Greek. In England tragedians
played Shakespeare in the costumes of their own day
down through Garrick, Siddons, and Kemble. And do you
imagine that all this had the slightest effect on the plays, any
bearing on their expression of the inner Form rather than the
outward shape of life? In spite of the flesh-and-blood actor,
clothed in the costumes of the time, the playwright was saved
from mere representation, from all this peep-hole business of
Realism. Doubtless he was saved because the temper of his
time was not corrupted and twisted and tortured by the unholy
union of science and capitalism. But it is rather interesting
to remember that the actors appeared in theaters so utterly
unreal, so essentially theatrical, that nobody could imagine
for a moment that he was standing with his eye glued to a
chink in the fourth wall.</p>

<p>The theaters of the past united the temporal and the eternal,
the passing moment and the permanent Form partly in
innocence, and partly from a natural ability to understand
things better in their own terms. We, too, can grasp more
of the Form of life if we see it derived from the life we
know. But this does not mean that the Elizabethans had the
slightest interest in the thing that has absorbed our stage—plausibility,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</span>
representation, resemblance. To-day we are
beginning again to desire reality of soul instead of mere reality
of body. We want to know about our own time and our own
people, but we don’t give a hang to learn how imperfectly,
how haltingly, a modern, realistic Hamlet would express his
thoughts on suicide.</p>

<p>It is easy enough to see how much Shakespeare’s greatest
tragedy would have lost if he had written like a Galsworthy.
Poetry of word is not the only thing that would have gone
by the board. Poetry of idea would have disappeared, too.
More than that, the ability of a character to express himself
would have been hideously confined within the formula of
plausibility. Perhaps so great an artist could have written
his tragedy without permitting a single person to speak an
inner thought that time and circumstance could not bring
out, but I am a little inclined to doubt it. And I am very
much inclined to assert that the vitality and the effectiveness
of such a work of unnatural and straining effort would have
been nothing beside the vitality and effectiveness of the <em>Hamlet</em>
we know.</p>

<p>For twenty years the European stage has struggled over
the problem of plausibility and resemblance in setting. The
thing called the new movement in the theater has spent half
the time devising mechanisms and technique for achieving
genuine representation instead of the bastard thing that tried
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</span>to make a dining room out of badly painted and flimsy canvas.
And it has spent about half the time trying to get rid of this
machinery and this technique in order to escape the Realism
which demanded such things. In Stockholm you see the touring
company of the Moscow Art Theater playing realistic
plays in just the sort of ugly, cheap, old setting that Craig,
Reinhardt and Belasco equally set their faces against. In
Dresden you see Shaw’s <em>Pygmalion</em> played at the State
Schauspielhaus in settings as solid and illusive as stone and
wood. In Paris you see the Russian Georges Pitoëff giving
Andreyeff’s <em>He Who Gets Slapped</em> in black curtains with four
ribbons looped up to indicate the form of a circus tent, and
Tchehoff’s <em>The Seagull</em> in settings which go back to the old
flapping canvas flats again, admitting that the theater is a
place of pretense, and which then attempt—not very successfully—to
give these flats, in color and outline, the Form of
the play.</p>

<p>Still further along the way from Realism to an expressionist
stage, you find Copeau’s naked stage in Paris that unites
frankly with the auditorium, and changes very little from
<em>The S. S. Tenacity</em> to <em>Les Frères Karamazov</em>. Finally in
Vienna, you find, in the Redoutensaal made from the ballroom
of Maria Theresa’s palace, a theater without proscenium, machinery
or scenery, a theater where the actor is frankly the actor.
Here you have the culminating expression of the growing sense<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</span>
in Europe that, because the stage is so close to life in the presence
of the living actor, it need not and it must not attempt
to create the illusion of reality. Through such a conception
the theater is freed once more to seek the Form of life.</p>

THE PATH OF THE PLAY</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">The</span> story of the attempt of the theater to escape
from Realism is a curious story. As a deliberate
effort of the playwrights to see life in the terms of
Form instead of accidental actuality it goes back only half a
dozen years through the dramas of the Germans who adopted
the word Expressionism to describe their aim and technique.
It has hung potential for ten or fifteen years in the work of
the more advanced and philosophic designers and directors of
the new stagecraft, a waiting stimulus to the playwrights. As
an unconscious impulse to reach beyond the limits of Realism
its beginnings are to be traced back twenty, thirty, almost
forty years in the work of some of Europe’s ablest realists.</p>

<p>The two greatest figures in the modern theater—which is
the realistic theater—give the same demonstration of the limitations
of Realism, and turn in the same fashion away from
actuality and towards an intense spiritual vitality. Both Ibsen
and Strindberg come out of Romanticism into Realism, and
pass on into a Symbolism that is far on the way towards Expressionism.
In Ibsen the new tendency is clearly marked in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</span>
<em>The Wild Duck</em> (1884) and develops gradually through <em>The
Master Builder</em> (1892) to completion in <em>When We Dead
Awaken</em> (1899). Strindberg’s <em>Towards Damascus</em> (1898)
carries strong hints of the spiritual intensity which threatened
the outer reality of so many of Strindberg’s earlier plays; and
by 1902, in <em>Swanwhite</em> and <em>The Dream Play</em>, he is well embarked
on a type of non-realistic drama which finds a bizarre
culmination in <em>The Spook Sonata</em> in 1907.</p>

<p>Two other European playwrights of distinction—Tchehoff
and Wedekind—show a similar dissatisfaction with pure Realism,
though neither passes through the three stages of development
to be traced in Ibsen and Strindberg. The work of
Tchehoff and the work of Wedekind is all pretty much of a
piece. It is never wholly realistic in the narrowest sense.
Each has a peculiar quality and method throughout. Tchehoff,
beginning in 1896 with <em>The Seagull</em>, keeps to a Realism of
such intense spiritual truth that, in a performance of his <em>The
Cherry Orchard</em> by the Moscow Art Theater such as I have
described, its extraordinary virtues are the virtues of Expressionism.
Wedekind’s first play, the thesis-drama <em>The Awakening
of Spring</em>, written in 1891, is stamped with his curious
and violent intensity, and his sense of the spiritual overtones
of life. In 1895 and 1903 he produced in the two parts of
<em>Lulu</em>—<em>Erdgeist</em> and <em>Pandora’s Box</em>—dramas horrifically actual
in their pictures of sexual aberration and at the same time<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</span>
so intense psychologically and so sharply defined and apt in
action that their Realism treads close on the boundaries which
Expressionism has over-passed.</p>

<p>There is a curious distinction in end and means between
such plays as these of Ibsen, Strindberg, Tchehoff, and Wedekind,
and the newer expressionist dramas of Germany and
America. The earlier plays indulge in symbolic, fantastic,
deeply spiritual ideas, but their language is almost always highly
realistic. They are still bound to the past of their authors and
to the present of their theater. The newer expressionist
dramas, on the other hand, are as free in speech as they are in
idea. It is a freedom that often makes a harmonious wedding
of end and means. Sometimes, as in plays of <em>Der Sturm</em> group,
the language is so completely free from the bonds of actuality
that it approaches the onomatopoetic verse of Mallarmé depending
on sound for its sense. In Eugene O’Neill’s distinguished
piece of Expressionism, <em>The Hairy Ape</em>, the playwright
strikes a happy medium with speech which is realistic
and characteristic in idiom but which is developed in idea, intensity
and length of utterance clean past the possibilities of
the people of the play. Occasionally you find a pseudo-expressionist
piece like <em>Vatermord</em>, by Arnold Bronnen, whose action
is naturalistic—grossly naturalistic—but whose language is
often far from natural. This piece was first produced in Berlin
in the summer of 1922 when the mind of the German capital<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</span>
could safely be described as neurotic. Its subject matter—the
incest and patricide of the Œdipus complex, with a little adventitious
homosexuality, all circling about a boy in his ’teens—produced
a stormy session between adherents and opponents,
a session finally ended by the <em>Schutzpolizei</em> with rifles and the
command: “Sei ruhig, meine Herrschaften!” The run which
followed at one of the theaters formerly directed by Max Reinhardt
may be explained by the notorious subject matter, but
there were critics to assert that Bronnen had a style of considerable
power as well as novelty. The boy’s final speech, as he
staggers onto the stage from an inner room, where he has
killed his father, and rebuffs the passionate entreaties of his
mother, is translated from the printed version, retaining the
one form of punctuation used, the slanting dash to indicate the
end of a line, though not necessarily of a sentence:</p>

<p class="no-indent fs80">
I’m through with you / I’m through with everything / Go bury<br>
your husband you are old / I am young / I don’t know you /<br>
I am free /<br>
<br>
Nobody in front of me nobody next to me nobody over me father’s<br>
dead / Heaven I spring up to you I fly / It pounds shakes groans<br>

rise<br>
<br>
<span style="margin-left: 16em;">I</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 14em;">I bloom</span><br>
</p>

<p class="no-indent">Before such an arrangement of words <em>The Spook Sonata</em>
seems almost mid-Victorian. The Student speaks to the ghostly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</span>
Milkmaid in the most matter of fact fashion. Even the old
Mummy, the mad woman who always sits in a closet, talks
like a most realistic parrot when she is not talking like a most
realistic woman. Here it is the ideas that stagger and affright
you, the molding minds, the walking Dead, the cook who
draws all the nourishment out of the food before she serves
it, the terrible relations of young and old; all of them are
things having faint patterns in actuality and raised by Strindberg
to a horrible clarity.</p>

<p>To follow the banner of Expressionism in playwriting—I
say nothing of stage setting, for that is, happily, another
matter—requires all three Graces and a strong stomach.
The bizarre morbidity, the nauseating sexuality, the lack of
any trace of joy or beauty, which characterize the work of
most of those who labeled themselves expressionists in Germany
during the past few years, match Strindberg at his
unhappiest, while the vigor with which they drive their ideas
forth in speech far outdoes him. Expressionism, in the narrow
sense in which such plays define it, is a violent storm of
emotion beating up from the unconscious mind. It is no
more than the waves which shatter themselves on the shore
of our conscious existence, only a distorted hint of the deep
and mysterious sea of the unconscious. Expressionism, as we
have so far known it, is a meeting of the fringes of the conscious
and the unconscious, and the meeting is startling indeed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</span></p>

<p>Germany’s reception of the expressionist plays was open-minded,
as is Germany’s reception of almost all new effort.
The dramas of the best of the expressionists—Georg Kaiser and
Walter Hasenclever—were produced in leading theaters, on
the official stages of Dresden and of Frankfort, and in
Reinhardt’s playhouses, for example. But by the summer of
1922 they had disappeared from the very catholic and long-suffering
repertories of these houses, and while Wedekind and
Strindberg were produced from Stockholm to Vienna, the
simon-pure expressionists, the playwrights of what I think it
is fair to call the lesser Expressionism, were hardly to be seen.
Only the one-act opera, <em>Mörder, Hoffnung der Frauen</em>, a
composition by Paul Hindemith on a playlet by the artist-author,
Oskar Kokoschka, was being played.</p>

<p>This piece, produced at the City Opera House in Frankfort,
points an interesting union and parallel between at least
one sort of Expressionism and music. The action, passing
in some indefinite olden time, is symbolically very difficult—quite
as difficult as its title, <em>Murderer, Hope of Women</em>. The
emotion of the scenes, on the other hand, is clear enough,
and it receives from the music a background of color, a
tonal reinforcement, that is most welcome; at the same time
the composer finds in the vigorous and intense, if somewhat
arbitrary, feeling of the playwright a provocative challenge.</p>

Kokoschka. Ramps lead from the center of the

at either side and by a grilled doorway in

<br>

<p>Kokoschka himself designed a setting for <em>Mörder, Hoffnung
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</span>der Frauen</em> when it was first produced at the Albert
Theater in Dresden as a play. A photograph of the production
betrays an uneasy setting, hardly stage-worthy in arrangement
and composition, and rather badly executed. The pages
of <em>Die Neue Schaubühne</em> have shown several other expressionist
stage designs as unsatisfactory, but in the more widely known
productions these pieces have been lucky enough to fall into
the hands of first-rate men like Adolf Linnebach of Dresden
and Ludwig Sievert of Frankfort. Sketches made from
Linnebach’s production of Hasenclever’s <em>Jenseits</em> in Dresden
show a simple and effective use of light and shadow and of
little else, with certain necessary elements of design projected
by a sort of magic-lantern technique upon the background
of dome or curtain. In actual performance Sievert’s setting
for the Kokoschka opera is strong and arresting with dark surfaces
massed in triangles symbolic of the feminine element
dominant in the piece, and with a successful, if not very
subtle, use of red and red-orange on the pylon surfaces guarding
the prison door. The direction of the singers and chorus,
under the hand of Dr. Ernst Lert, is a thoroughly expressive
part of music and setting.</p>

<p>Though the most celebrated plays of the expressionist pioneers
have failed to make a place for themselves in the German
repertory, they have had their effect. Playwrights who
might have written in the conventional mode have been<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</span>
turned towards a freer technique, and they have succeeded in
accomplishing interesting and promising things. The most
notable of the plays thus produced, <em>Masse-Mensch</em>, deserves a
chapter to itself. I shall write here of two lesser works by
Karel Capek, one seen in the Czech National Theater, where
it was first produced, the other read in a German translation.</p>

<p>In the first, <em>The Insect Comedy</em>, Karel Capek’s brother, a
scenic artist, has a share as collaborator. It is a fantastic
and picturesque piece of satire providing excellent opportunities
for the newer methods in production. It is a comment on
post-war conditions as symbolized in the life of butterflies,
beetles, and ants. The prolog finds a young man wandering
in the woods, and puts him comfortably to sleep on a grassy
bank after a little talk with an absurdly pedantical entomologist.
He sleeps through the three succeeding acts surrounded
and occasionally disturbed by figures of insects grown life-size.
The first act passes with the brilliant butterflies, who stand
for the heedless, unproductive men and women of the social
and pseudo-artistic worlds with time for only chatter and flirtation
while disaster rumbles beneath them. In the production
of this scene, the <em>régisseur</em>, K. H. Hilar, keeps the
players moving ceaselessly, their hands and heads lightly undulating,
with the restlessness of the antennæed world, while high
around the back of the scene various of the brightly costumed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</span>
insects constantly dance behind the translucent curtain of the
woods.</p>

<p>In the second scene the humble grubs crawl in and out of
their burrows on busy errands of accumulation. These are
the assiduous profiteers and misers of war-time society. The
act ends in a broad touch of comedy. A beetle has been murdering
passing insects and dragging their bodies down below
for his wife to hoard. There enters The Parasite, a tramp
bug. He does not work. Why should he? He has only to
wait for the busy capitalists of his world to fill their larders.
Then, when the time comes, he will rise—or more accurately
descend—and the wealth of the world will be his. He ducks
into the beetle’s hole, and in a few moments he comes up, a
swollen and jovial Communist, dancing in glee. The ever-present
prompter’s box serves conveniently for one of the
holes, and the background of green and black woods is projected
instead of painted; otherwise there is little of interest
in the staging of this scene.</p>

<p>The third act carries us to the ants. Here are the eternal
laborers, tramping in an endless circle upon their work, under
the eye of superiors very like officers and to a rhythm beaten
out by a more privileged one of their own number. The
Capeks costume the army of ants in khaki, puttees and all,
and provide a desolate hill for a background. It might be
blasted by either war or commerce. Into its surface descend<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</span>
shafts that might lead to either mines or dugouts. A glowering
background of crazy chimneys and telegraph poles and
smoke—all projected on the cyclorama—completes the picture.
Presently there come shouting and a courier. More couriers.
War threatens. The ants drop their burdens for rifles and
continue their march. The officer-ants assume a higher station
and even loftier phrases of command; from the back they
philosophize and give orders in good old Kaiser-fashion. The
act culminates with a conflict and the lordship of a new race
of ants.</p>

<p>The epilog is divided between the appearance from her
chrysalis of an ephemera of whom the sleeping man has been
dimly and hopefully conscious in the last two scenes, her
death after a dance with other short-lived mayflies, and the
despairing end of the human visitor. This end is commented
upon in a half satiric and half aspiring vein through the introduction
of a group of wanderers who come upon the dead
body, gaze at it in astonishment and sadness for a moment,
and then pass on, singing, upon the ever-creative way of
the peasant.</p>

<p><em>R. U. R.</em>, Karel Capek’s other play (in German, <em>W. U. R.</em>)
is a tale of a Frankenstein such as H. G. Wells might have
written in his earlier days. It seems both gruesomely effective
and at times philosophic. The letters “R. U. R.” are
an abbreviation of the name of a firm engaged in manufacturing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</span>
“<em>Roboters</em>,” or workmen stamped out and given life
by a machine. After a not very skilful exposition of the
nature of this new device for lightening the world’s work,
the play passes on to show the degenerating effect upon mankind
of ceasing to labor. The “<em>Roboters</em>” are given pain in
order to remind them not to be careless and break their legs
and arms. Thereupon they acquire something not unlike a
soul. Presently comes a consciousness of their station and
their power. They rise and kill all mankind—except one
man. Later they find to their dismay that the secret formula
of the materials from which they were stamped out has been
destroyed. They wear out in twenty years. And there
will be an end. The last act shows their frantic appeal
for a way to perpetuate themselves. The one man finds
it at last when he recognizes love awakening in a male and
a female “<em>Roboter</em>.” The process of mankind will begin once
more. Rather the sort of end that Anatole France would
have put to the story—Frankenstein turned man.</p>

<p>None of this, of course—either Kaiser or Capek—is Expressionism
very far on its way. Some of it is trivial. Some is
interesting enough. Much is decadent or uncertain. But it
is not difficult to believe that there is something of the future
in it. It is a sign. There is a starlike gleam in even the worst
of the mire. Vitality, though often a morbid vitality, animates
it. When we see Eugene O’Neill saying Nay to Realism<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</span>
in the same fashion, and turning out so strong and significant
a play as <em>The Hairy Ape</em>—a play that grows greater
in the perspective of Europe—it is not very difficult to hope
and to look forward.</p>

<p>In the artists who give Expressionism a physical form and
a pictorial atmosphere upon the stage we find still more of
hope. They have gone more quickly and more securely
towards their goal. They have had a disciplinary practice
upon the plays of an earlier time, a time before Realism.
They are freed from the moral problems of the writer; and
where their work is distempered with the morbidity,
the unhealthiness, of so much of our time, the result is less
obvious in color or design than it would be if it took the
form of words. And they have had behind them the history
and the example of the movement in art which we once called
Post-Impressionism, but which follows logically into Expressionism,
the movement of Cézanne, Van Gogh, Matisse,
Picasso, Duchamp.</p>

<p>The problem for the expressionist play is the problem of
music. And yet not its problem; for music, being so markedly
apart from actuality in its materials, has made few and not
very successful attempts at the Realism which has swamped
our stage. Music has been by very nature expressionistic. It
has failed whenever, as program music, it approached the
suggestion of the actual. For the rest, it has soared, soared<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</span>
easily, surely, towards direct expression of spiritual reality.
Expressionism in the theater has to seek the way of music,
the way towards beauty and ecstasy. The difficulty of the
playwright is that he must always feel the pull of the actual
life about him; he must make his drama out of human beings
and not out of pure vision or pure emotional response. The
world about him is corrupt and corrupting outwardly, as well
as beautiful and wonderful within. He cannot, like the
musician, leap away from its entanglements by putting his
hands to an instrument of abstract art. But he can gain a
certain release by forswearing as much as possible the reproduction
of the actual.</p>

BLACK CURTAINS</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">To-day</span> we are thinking more and more of the
future of the theater, the future of the play and
the playwright, the future of production, of direction
and the actor.</p>

<p>If we are to think of the future to any effect, we must think
of the past as well as the present. The path of to-morrow
strikes off from the maze of to-day. To guess at its direction
with much chance of success, we must look now and then at
the map of the settled roads of yesterday.</p>

<p>If we want to estimate the chances of the non-realistic
play to advance beyond its expressionist beginnings in Germany,
we must try to understand the present state of the art
of theatrical production, and the past of play and players, the
theater and its stagecraft. A share of the future—a very
large share, I believe—may lie with America; but the past
is Continental. And a surprising amount of the past is German.</p>

<p>The past of the play shows one interesting peculiarity. The
great plays of the romantic movement were developed where
there were great theaters, in France and in Germany. Quite<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</span>
otherwise with Realism. Its greatest works—the plays of
Ibsen and Strindberg—were created in small countries almost
outside the consciousness of the nineteenth century theater.
This was natural enough. Realistic plays were, in the last
analysis, lonely literary rationalizations. They were not
theatrical. They did not spring out of the theater. Instead
they altered the theater to suit their needs. The theater that
they altered most was the German theater, and there the dramas
of the Scandinavians found their best audience.</p>

<p>But the German theater, being a healthy theater, could not
stop at the point where it became an almost perfect mechanism
for presenting these plays. Its directors and its artists went
on experimenting. They had old plays to mount, also, plays
out of the romantic and classic periods. They put their brains
and their machines at work upon these pieces, as well as upon
the realistic, and soon they had developed methods of production
for non-realistic plays quite as admirable for the purpose
as any of their tricks for lifting the fourth wall before
our very eyes. The German theatrical organization became
more and more restive under the realistic plays and the old
“classics.” It was preparing for something new. The <em>Zeitgeist</em>
was working. Soon it began to work upon the playwrights.
There came abortive beginnings in the expressionist
plays I have written about in the last chapter. And the German
theater went on—and goes on—experimenting.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</span></p>

<p>Let us look at this theater a little more closely. For it is
the Continental theater to-day as it was yesterday; France
has only Copeau, England experiments in little theaters as
America experimented ten years ago. And where the Continental
theater is, there we are very likely indeed to find the
Continental play of the future. The expressionist drama, like
every school of drama except the realistic, is a product of the
theater in form and vitality, quite as much as it is a product
of society in its mind and materials.</p>

<p>The story of the artistic development of the German
theater past the realistic stage is familiar enough. It began
in 1905, it was fairly complete by 1914. It was founded
upon Gordon Craig and Adolphe Appia, and it is symbolized
in the name of Max Reinhardt. It made Realism still for
Ibsen and Strindberg; but it plowed past the Realism of Otto
Brahm—which is the Realism of Belasco—and it achieved a
pregnant actuality so direct and simple that it soon gave birth
to a new imagination.</p>

<p>The new methods of production are fairly easy to grasp.
They rest on a few general principles. The pretenses of the
theater had to be successful pretenses. To begin with, certain
tricks of the old theater were forsworn, tricks in the main
that failed to succeed. Such an obvious pretense as painted
perspective had to go. Footlights had to be curbed; for the
illumination must be both more natural and more beautiful.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</span>
But, beyond these negative things, the directors sought to
achieve positive effects for which they had to call into the
theater artists of first-rate ability. The business of these artists,
whether working on a realistic play or an imaginative one, was
to evoke the atmosphere of the piece in setting and in lights.
They fell back on three general principles to aid their sense
of line and color in visually dramatizing the action. In the
first place they simplified the stage picture. They subordinated
or eliminated detail. They put as little as possible on
the stage that might distract the spectator from the meaning
of the general design (which was the meaning of the play),
or from the actions and speeches of the characters. Then,
by an adroit use of simple materials and forms, they enriched
the setting—along the lines of the play—through suggestion.
One detail suggested the nature of the whole. The base of a
huge column made the audience visualize for itself the size
of the building. Half an arch springing off into darkness
created the impression of a great vaulted structure. Finally
came a synthesis of all the available and appropriate forces
of the theater, and of all the qualities of the play; this implying
for the director the establishment of a certain apt rhythm
in the performance.</p>

<p>This pictorial reform, backed by such direction and acting
as the German theater alone was able to supply, and utilizing
all manner of mechanical devices for scene-shifting and lighting,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</span>
has stood to us for some ten years as the so-called new
movement in the theater. It has been familiar through the
names of Craig and Appia as pioneer theorists, of Reinhardt,
and of artists like Ernst Stern and Alfred Roller; through an
occasional production from abroad, like Reinhardt’s <em>Sumurûn</em>;
and, at last, through the exceptional work of our own artists
in America and the men—from Arthur Hopkins to directors
of little theaters—who have given them their opportunities
or amplified their conceptions.</p>

<p>Fringing the outside of all this in the past have been bastard
minglings of old technique and new spirit, such as Bakst and
the Ballets Russes displayed, and the beginnings of theory
and experiment leading towards a new—or a very old—sort
of theater, a theater cut off from the whole peep-hole convention
of the proscenium and the fourth wall.</p>

<br>

<p>The strength of this movement in Germany lay partly in
a very few talented directors like Reinhardt and artists like
Stern, but very greatly in the vigorous and healthy organization
of the German theater. Because of the division of Germany
in small kingdoms and duchies, there had always been
many centers of artistic life, each about a court in the capital.
In a score of cities, enriched by industrial development, there
were theaters endowed by the state or the city, and directed
towards the highest artistic accomplishment. In the larger
cities privately owned theaters followed the lead of the public
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</span>institutions. The strength of these houses lay in their endowment,
their ideals, and their system of organization. This was
the repertory system. Here, as nowhere in England or America
and only here or there in France, were theaters directed
by a single mind, employing a permanent company of players,
maintaining a repertory of plays, old and new, given in
recurring succession night after night, theaters retaining
therefore a permanent audience, dependable both in pocketbook
and in taste. Supplementing these theaters were organizations
of playgoers among the middle and lower classes, such
as the Freie Volksbühne in Berlin, which widened the audience
of subscribers to good work in the theater. Between
endowment and the security of a permanent audience, it was
possible for these German theaters to give uncommonly fine
performances at uncommonly low prices.</p>

<p>Along with the development of new methods in production
went a good deal of activity in theater building. In
practice, as well as in theory, Max Littmann and Oskar Kaufmann,
following Schinkel and Semper, who had worked with
Goethe and Wagner, did much to improve the auditoriums of
German theaters. The result is not so marked as in the case
of the scenic artists. Most of the theaters are old indeed and
awkwardly shaped, and too many of the new ones continue the
tradition of a parquet surrounded and surmounted by three
or four shallow, horseshoe-shaped balconies. These balconies<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</span>
are not so good to see or hear from as our own. A realization
of the awkwardness of these shelves or <em>Rangen</em>, as they are
termed in German, produced an opposition, headed by Littmann,
that called for their elimination and for the substitution
of an amphitheater type of house with no balconies and with a
steeper floor to allow of better sight-lines. The fight of <em>Ring
vs. Rang</em> has resulted in several auditoriums designed by Littmann,
the Prinzregenten Theater and the Künstler, for example,
in Munich, the slant of whose floors is far too sharp;
from the upper rows, the players are seen as in some far-off
pit. The slant is greater than necessary, and absolutely
straight; the practice of the American architect, H. C. Ingalls,
of grading the floor in a gradually increasing curve, produces
a far better effect. A compromise between <em>Rang</em> and <em>Ring</em>
might be found in a development of the American house
with only one balcony; a more steeply slanting floor than we
ordinarily have would thus bring two amphitheaters or <em>Rings</em>
into a single auditorium. Germany possesses, however, some
admirable playhouses in the Kammerspielhaus formerly
directed by Reinhardt in Berlin, in the Volksbühne designed
by Oskar Kaufmann, and in many features of the Künstler
Theater. The seating arrangements have formed one of the
best features of the German houses. The chairs are almost
always too thinly padded; but the elimination of aisles more
than compensates. The whole audience is united in a single<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</span>
responsive body. And because each row is a little wider than
ours and the side walls of the auditoriums are liberally supplied
with doors, the audience empties out more quickly than
ours and in an orderly manner that puts American fire-regulations
to shame. I have seen the three thousand spectators of
the Volksbühne walk out in a single minute. It takes from
three to four for a small theater in New York, seating only
six hundred, to clear itself.</p>

<p>A factor that has done a great deal for the progress of the
German theater and the reputation of the new stagecraft, is
the liberal attitude of the German periodicals and publishing
houses towards new things in the theater. Editors and writers
have been so eager to present to the public every smallest reform
in setting or theater that the world has gained rather
an optimistic view of the extent of production progress in
Germany. Just as it is a fact that only in a few theaters will
you find model auditoriums in Central Europe, in a similar
way you discover that the outstanding work of design before
the war was done by two men, Stern and Roller, and that the
other men whose names decorate the records of the new stagecraft
were each responsible for only a few productions.</p>

<p>One thing further you may learn about the past of the German
movement, even in an investigation so late as the summer
of 1922. And that is that the color in a great majority of
the stage settings has been very far from good. The German<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</span>
has an ear, a very marvelous ear; only the Russian can approach
him in music, and it is not a near approach. But his eye is bad.
Germany has produced no first-rate artists except Dürer,
Schongauer and perhaps Cranach, and Dürer and Schongauer
are celebrated as etchers rather than as painters. That should
have been caution enough for those of us who had to study
the German stage at the distance of the half-tone. The fact
of the matter is that the German is a splendid theorist, a man
of large conceptions, and that therefore in the theater he has
been able to design settings of simple and excellent proportions,
which create a good effect in black-and-white. It is his sense
of color that is at fault. Stern, with the mixture of the Oriental
in his blood which did so much for Bakst, and some of
the artists from Vienna and the South brought something
to the stage besides dramatic imagination and sense of proportion.
The test of color downs the rest.</p>

<p>When we think of the future of the German theater we
must naturally think of the present also, and it is a black
present. Germany has been shattered spiritually as well as
economically. It has fallen from dreams of world-dominion
to bankruptcy and enslavement. The effect of this upon the
mind of the citizen who has come through four years of danger
and privation, is staggering. One incident of the fall, which
you learn upon visiting Germany, is sharply significant. Until
the soldiers from the broken German armies began to stream<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</span>
back into the Rhine provinces in November, 1918, the men
and women behind the front believed that their forces were
victorious. It is possible for the theater to go on physically
under almost any conditions of privation; but you must reckon
spiritually with an extraordinary state of the public mind when
you prophesy the future of the German theater. Two things,
perhaps, make optimism possible. One: Germany and the
German people have gone through terrible things before; there
was the Thirty Years War. Two: Germany still has the wonderfully
trained audience of pre-war days; it was a broad
democratic audience, and no shift in economic circumstances
can destroy so large a part of the cultured playgoers as war-poverty
has done in England, in France, and even to some
extent in America.</p>

<p>War—backed by the movies—has done its worst in the
Berlin theater. Here we find another example of the exchange
of ideals and personalities which has often been noted between
victor and vanquished. Just as America has been Prussianized
in its attitude towards the foreigner and the liberal or radical
minority, Berlin has adopted many of the most evil features
of the American theatrical system. Within three years of
the close of hostilities Berlin was being rapidly Broadway-ized.
Repertory was practically dead at all but three or four
theaters. Facing economic difficulties and the competition
of the movies for the services of the actors, Berlin found<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</span>
it was a large enough city to support long runs for exceptionally
great or exceptionally mediocre plays. Even the three theaters
that Reinhardt formerly directed broke from repertory,
and where they had once shown ten or a dozen productions
in two weeks, they showed only three or (counting Sunday
matinees of some old favorites) four. Outside Berlin, repertory
continues in the State and City theaters and even in private
ventures; but many artistic playhouses are badly crippled by
the economic troubles of the nation, and some are forced to
close down.</p>

<p>There are certain good signs. The theaters were full in
1922. In fifty or sixty visits to the theater it was only at
musical comedies that I saw more than one row of vacant
seats; in all but half a dozen cases every seat was sold and
occupied. The prices were not high. In Frankfort, an average
city of the larger size, the highest prices ranged from
sixty marks (at that time twenty cents) to one hundred and
twenty marks, depending on the expensiveness or the popularity
of the production; while the lowest prices for seats
were twenty marks to seventy marks, with standing room at
six marks.</p>

<p>At such prices even full houses do not make budgets easy
to balance. The theater of post-war Germany must be economical
in its expenditures. That is not, however, such an
artistic hardship as much of the talk of elaborate machinery<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</span>
and handsome productions in pre-war days might suggest.
Rigorous physical simplicity and a reliance on the genius of
design instead of elaboration of mechanics are the vital needs
in stage setting to-day. Germany has done fine things in the
simplifying of production, and it has done them in spite of
the temptations of bulging pocketbooks. What it may be
forced to do now through poverty is a matter for real hope.</p>

<p>The danger—for there is a danger—is that smaller minds
may find an excuse for a mean sort of simplicity, a bareness
and barrenness of spirit. There has always been a tendency
among the modern directors and designers to economize spiritually
as well as economically. The results have been seen in
some of our dry, meager “little theater” productions, full of
bare formalism—a sort of “simplism” that has no place in
any art, let alone in the live, varied, rich, and vigorous theater.
Occasionally a German artist of real talent falls into this thin
manner; Ludwig Sievert has mounted <em>Towards Damascus</em> at
the Frankfort Schauspielhaus upon a scheme which is physically
interesting, but he has given his settings a mean, arid,
spiritually poverty-stricken appearance which is never beautiful,
and does not express in the least the intense quality of
Strindberg’s play.</p>

<p>The movies break up ensemble in Germany, and bear down
on repertory. They offer salaries that the actor, impoverished
quite as much as the worker, cannot resist. Moreover they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</span>
demand from him the daylight hours which must be given
to rehearsals of old and new pieces if repertory is to exist.
The German actor cannot appear in a repertory theater in the
evenings, as our actor can appear upon Broadway, and put in
his days in front of the camera, as ours often does. But—and
this is highly important—the German actor has been
trained in a school of ideals and self-expression which makes
him demand more than the movies can give him. He must
have some sort of serious work in the theater, and he is finding
it more and more in special summer engagements or
<em>Festspiele</em>. Thus many of the greatest of the nation’s players
are often assembled at salaries which, by comparison with their
motion picture earnings, are hardly salaries at all.</p>

<p>There remains the spirit of the German people. The audiences
are intact and intelligent, but what about their spirit?
Can these people live down their sufferings or lift them up
to something great outside themselves? The prospect is not
so dark in the southern parts, in Bavaria, perhaps; it is certainly
bright in Austria, where hunger and economic misery
are the realest and where the divinity of the human spirit is
asserted again and again in every happy gesture of this lovely
people. In Berlin it is another matter. Spiritual dejection
and gnawing misery are in the face of every one. They are
to be seen on the stage, too. Berlin does not go to the theater
to be taken out of itself; it seems to neglect the prime use of art.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</span>
Berlin demands an echoing misery from its playhouses. It
goes to see a blacker and more despicable <em>Richard III</em> than
Shakespeare ever imagined. It suffers the torments of disillusioned
revolution in <em>Masse-Mensch</em> at the working people’s
theater. It throngs the glowering caverns of the Grosses
Schauspielhaus. And everywhere the stage is hung in black
curtains. “Warum immer die schwarzen Vorhänge?” we
ask again and again. Perhaps they are only an accident of the
attempt to get a background of emptiness; but they become a
yawning gulf of spiritual blackness. The only colors to break
the pall are the red of blood, and the blue that strikes across
the black a symbol of a sinister cruelty.</p>

<p>Of course, black curtains are no Teuton monopoly. When
the Russian Pitoëff uses them in Paris, when we see them on
Broadway and in our “little theaters,” we do not look for the
words “Made in Germany” on the selvage. But in Germany
they seem numerous and more significant. If the curtains
were sometimes dappled with gray or if they were opalescent
with hidden lights, they might be significant of nothing more
than the Germans’ immensely active experiments with a formal
stage. Perhaps <em>bunte Vorhänge</em> are coming. Perhaps
it is always a little dark before dawn.</p>

THE TWILIGHT OF THE MACHINES</h2>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">There</span> are many things upon the German stage
besides black dawn. The twilight of the machines,
for instance, and all the past of the new stagecraft
lagging superfluous.</p>

<p>Even the past of the old stagecraft. In the same theater
in Frankfort where one of the three significant pairs of German
directors and artists labors, I have seen <em>Peer Gynt</em> given
as incompetently as any patron of an American small-town
stock company could demand. The settings were hideous;
the same badly painted backdrop served for two or three scenes
in different localities; the revolving stage rumbled noisily and
did nothing to shorten intermissions. While the orchestra
played Grieg’s introductory music in the wings and the stage
was dark, waiting actors, who imagined that thereby ears as
well as eyes were dimmed, restlessly shifted from one foot
to another in squeaky shoes. At the beginning of each scene
the lights came up like thunder. Through as many scenes
as could be endured, the same players who gave a sharp, almost
electric performance of <em>Maria Stuart</em> the next night, acted
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</span><em>Peer Gynt</em> dully and sloppily to a running fire of assistance
from the prompter’s box. It is worth remarking, incidentally,
that the <em>souffleur</em>, as he is euphemistically called, is no
necessity in the repertory theater. He may give a complete
and studied reading of the text one lap ahead of the actors
in the Grosses Schauspielhaus, the Frankfort Schauspielhaus,
the Burgtheater in Vienna, the Lessing Theater in Berlin,
and a dozen other first-class theaters; but you don’t hear his
voice in the State Schauspielhaus of Berlin under Jessner, in
Copeau’s Vieux-Colombier in Paris, or during a performance
of <em>Masse-Mensch</em> at the Volksbühne.</p>

<p>The past of the German stage is seldom slovenly, but it is
often disturbing. To see in 1922 a setting by Roller for <em>Die
Meistersinger</em> is like encountering at a fashionable New York
<em>thé dansant</em> the girl you used to take to high school dances in
St. Louis in 1907. The German stage is full of such disquieting
reminders of juvenile infatuations; Sweden is not
exempt. The work of the pioneers and imitations of the work
of the pioneers are still to be seen. Verdi’s <em>Macbeth à la</em> Craig
at the Stockholm Opera; <em>The Sunken Bell</em> at the Grosses
Schauspielhaus with Stern’s hill from <em>Penthesilea</em>; Reinhardt
effects in <em>Maria Stuart</em> in Frankfort; good old Russian painting
in faked perspective in <em>Florian Geyer</em> in Munich; a wedding
of Heinrich Leffler and Maxfield Parrish at Dresden in
the Verdi opera which the Germans so cheerfully translate as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</span>
<em>Der Troubadour</em>; the style, if you can call it that, of the Washington
Square Players in <em>Towards Damascus</em> in Frankfort.
Everywhere traces of Reinhardt and Craig and Roller.</p>

<p>Roller, alone of the artists who were new fifteen years ago,
is still busy in the theater. The mood he arouses is mixed. It
is thoroughly annoying to find him so unable to grasp the problem
of setting in the remarkable new theater in the Redoutensaal
in Vienna, unable to see that the Gobelins and the
crystal, the golden moldings and the rich baroque ornament of
that marvelous room which is both stage and auditorium, must
set the style and color of the screens and formal set pieces
of the stage. It is a little sad to see Roller trying in <em>Kain</em> at
the Burgtheater to adopt the steps and black curtains and
the one or two plastics of the newer and younger men. When
he is decking out some war-horse like <em>Die Meistersinger</em> in the
good old style of the revolutionists of 1910, you have to forgive
him much, even while you wonder at the limitations of
so many of the stage designers outside Russia. Take the first
scene, for example. Dramatically the thing is right in proportion
and arrangement. It is an interesting composition of
wall spaces and doors, which becomes all the more interesting
when the director has arranged the many costumed characters
in waves that ripple along the shore of the picture and roll up
here and there about some promontory of the design. But
when you look away from composition to color, you see a lack.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</span>It is not the difficulty of bad color, which besets most of the
Germans; Roller and Stern generally escape that. The fact
of the matter is that there simply isn’t any color—in spite of
a furnace of dulled orange smoldering on the walls, and some
gray-greens damping it down for contrast. This is not color
in the sense that the Russians know it. Roller does not think
in color as does Nicolas Roerich. What Westerner does—or
ever has? Roller thinks in line and mass and proportion.
Then he goes to his paint-box, and selects two nicely contrasting
tones, more or less appropriate to a large medieval building.
He never bothers his head over the dramatic problem of
whether they mean anything in relation to the action, or the
artistic problem of whether he has made one of those subtle
arrangements of many curiously harmonizing colors, which, in
the alchemy of the eye, take on a psychic significance.</p>

<p>Such laggard things—the relics of Craig-ideas and the
work of various of the elder directors and artists—play a
more or less normal part in the life of the German stage. They
would find a parallel in any age. They know their place and
keep to it. Something that is only just beginning to learn
its proper and subordinate part in the advance of the theater
is the far-famed stage machinery of Germany.</p>

<p>It was the most natural thing in the world that the Germans
should turn their stage into a machine shop. When they build
one of their great five-story office buildings they begin by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</span>
laying a railroad along two sides on the street level and another
up in the air above it, and putting in a traveling elevator,
dump-cart, and crane that runs along on the tracks; after they
have this gigantic apparatus in order, building the building
is mere child’s play. <em>Der verrückte Krieg</em> was all that prevented
the development of a most ingenious mechanism for
erecting the erector that builds the building.</p>

<p>The German stage machine is a Frankenstein stage-hand.
It is intended to do the work of scene shifting at great economy
of effort and time. Actually the German theaters seem
to employ more stage hands than the American theaters, and
the waits are no shorter on the whole than those we are able
to manage if we want to.</p>

<p>There are two main divisions to the species. Lewis Carroll,
listing the different varieties of Snarks, supplied a formula.
There are those, it is said, that are round and revolve, and
those that have rollers and slide. The revolving stage—made
famous by the cohorts of Reinhardt—and the sliding stage—which
includes a sinking variety.</p>

<p>The revolving stage has its furious adherents. They include
Reinhardt, Stern, who utilized its shortcomings quite as marvelously
as its good points in his productions for Reinhardt,
and the host of Reinhardt disciples. It came from Japan in
1896 through Lautenschläger of Munich. It is a great circle
cut out of the stage floor and mounted on wheels so that it may<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</span>
be freely turned by hand or power. The circle is from forty
to sixty feet across, and usually occupies the greater part
of the stage space. On it the different settings are placed back
to back, anywhere from two to ten fitting snugly together.
One after another of these settings is presented in the opening
of the proscenium as the stage revolves. It retains its reputation
because it is the simplest and handiest scene-shifting
machine to use with the great solid plaster dome which Reinhardt
and so many other directors found essential as a substitute
for the flapping and wrinkling canvas sky.</p>

<p>The sliding stage pure and simple is just a couple of low
platforms the size of that part of the stage usually acted on.
These carry the settings and slide out sideways into the wings.
While one platform is in front of the proscenium with the
actors giving the play in its setting, the other is being reset at
the right or the left. It is easy to see that these platforms cannot
slide past either end of the plaster dome if it is far enough
down front to be of any use. The Deutsches Opernhaus in
Charlottenburg, Berlin, gets around this by having the whole
gigantic dome slide, too; hung from tracks and carrying its
lights with it, the dome is pushed back into the depths of the
stage when the platforms at the front have to slide. The
amusing feature is that the present director of the theater has
so little notion of what it is all for that in <em>Don Giovanni</em> he
makes a number of changes by rigging his flats and drops on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</span>
lines, as we might do, and hoisting them into the flies in full
view of the audience on what is by a polite fiction called a
dark stage.</p>

<p>All this whirling of palaces and scuttling of skies is child’s
play beside the sinking stage. As developed by Adolf Linnebach,
technical director of the State Schauspielhaus in Dresden,
it almost defies understanding or description. The
simplest variety is to be found across the National Gallery and
the Theaterplatz under the guiding and inventive hand of
Max Hasait of the State Opera House, Linnebach’s great
mechanical rival. The stage of the Opera is divided into seven
sections from the proscenium opening to the spot a hundred
feet back where the <em>Hinterbühne</em> or auxiliary rear-stage begins.
These seven sections can rise some feet above the stage
level or sink into the basement. While the front sections are
in the basement, carrying a setting that has already been used,
the rear sections, with another setting on them, can, by a
complicated arrangement, be rolled down on tracks to take the
place of the front sections in the proscenium opening. While
the front sections are in the basement the setting upon them
is changed; the same thing happens to the rear sections when
they are rolled back again. The stage of the Schauspielhaus
is far more complicated. It is divided in only three sections,
but when the two forward sections are in the basement, sliding
stages of the ordinary sort, which rest upon them, can be slid
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</span>out to the sides for changes of scene. On these sliding stages
small “wagon stages” or mechanical stage hands operate, carrying
large pieces such as stairs and mantels into place. Under
the orchestra pit at the front is another contrivance, like a
small stage on stilts, which can be trundled onto the first sinking
stage straddling the setting. Thus two stages are super-imposed,
and a sort of elevator stage produced, such as Steele
MacKaye once invented. Hasait is nursing a scheme for
rearranging his sinking and sliding stages so that the seven
stages may run forward, sink to the basement, slide back, rise,
and run forward again in rapid succession like an endless chain.
The prospect is distinctly startling. Opponents of the new
stagecraft have often claimed that the scenery ignores the
actor. With the sliding and sinking stage a little further
advanced, you can imagine the scenery taking a really furious
interest in the actor, pursuing him from floor to basement
and back again. You can imagine some new director working
out a drama in which a cathedral chases an apostate priest
about the stage, or a phallic column pursues the heroine into
the darkness of the cellar only to lose her as she rises triumphantly
on the last of the seven mystic stages guided and
blessed by that unique functionary of the German theater,
the <em>Obermaschineninspektor</em>.</p>

</div>
</figcaption>
</figure>
<br>

<p>There are peculiar disadvantages to these expensive mechanisms.
The revolving stage simply can’t handle certain scenes<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</span>
without ceasing to be a revolving stage. It is impossible to
use the entire width or depth of the stage for an exterior without
shoving all the other scenes off the “revolver,” and giving
up its use. All exterior scenes on the revolving stage have
to go up over the rooms set at the back. The western prairies
and the North German sea coast are equally unpopular with
the friends of the revolving stage. The exceptionally fine
production of <em>Masse-Mensch</em>—with its various great steps
the whole width and half the height of the stage, alternating
with flat open scenes—received almost no assistance from the
“revolver” at the Volksbühne in Berlin. The technical director,
putting this stage through its paces and exhibiting such
amusing tricks as its ability to rise or sink some six feet at either
end, thus producing a slanting floor, confessed that he much
preferred some other type of stage.</p>

<p>The sliding and sinking stage has fewer disadvantages; but
it is an elaborate, expensive, and cumbersome machine to do
the work that designers and stage hands might quite as well
accomplish. On the matter of expense, it is disquieting to
hear at a scene-rehearsal of <em>Das Rheingold</em> that one hundred
and fifty men, including electricians, are busy with this labor-saving
device. It is still more disturbing to the machine-worshiper
to time the intermissions in German theaters, and
to find that waits of from two to five minutes are quite as frequent<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</span>
as in America. The explanation, of course, is the costumes.
“The stage was all set in half a minute, but we had
to wait for the tenor to get into his blue tights.” It looks very
much as if the <em>Maschineninspektoren</em> should have introduced
sliding wardrobes or adapted the harnessing devices of fire-houses
before they put thousands of dollars into sliding stages.</p>

<p>The German technical men are beginning to chafe at the
limitations of the machines, to be content to push them into
second place. If you talk to Linnebach, at Dresden, once
high priest of the sliding stage, you will note with some surprise
that the word <em>einfach</em> has a Carolinian way of getting
into the conversation. Things must be simpler. No big solid
sets; instead, some curtains and lights and a dome on which
to project painted designs. The word <em>Podium</em> also crops out.
Like almost all forward-looking artists and directors in Germany,
Linnebach wants to put the actor on a sort of tribune
thrust out into the audience. He wants to give him back the
vital heritage of the Greek and the medieval stages. Linnebach
is content mechanically with the devices of the electrician;
when he mounted Hasenclever’s expressionist drama,
<em>Jenseits</em>, he made the setting out of light and shadow, a few
chairs and tables, only one or two set pieces, and some projected
backgrounds.</p>

<p>Machinery like the sinking stage has advantages apart from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</span>
its ability to change heavy realistic sets. It is difficult to see
how the opening scene of Shaw’s <em>Pygmalion</em>, looking out to
the street from under the portico of Covent Garden, could be
better created or more quickly shifted than in Linnebach’s
production. Certainly without the ability to sink with ease
the rear part of the stage three or four feet, he could not have
given us the natural effect of the street level below the eyes
of the audience and the actors. The great virtue of a mechanical
stage of this kind is not to shift scenery, so much as to supply
economically and quickly different levels for the actors to
play upon. The use of levels is one of the important advances
of the Continental theater since the war, and the sinking stage
helps greatly with this. With a few inner prosceniums and
simple backgrounds, it can supply, as it were, an infinite variety
of formal stages such as the Continental theater seems slowly
to be tending toward.</p>
<br>

</div>
</figcaption>
</figure>
<br>

<p>Barring the realistic and the formal, there is a middle
ground in which the machine is of little value compared with
the designer. In Linnebach’s theater—though not from his
designs—a Hindu romance, <em>Vasantasena</em>, was mounted frankly
and freshly against flat settings in the style of Indian miniatures.
This was accomplished, without the aid of stage
machinery, by the use of a permanent setting or portal of
Indian design, with steps and a platform, on which, framed
within an inner proscenium, drops and profiles were changed
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</span>much as we would change them. The artist, Otto Hettner,
supplied a style, as well as a formal stage, which made the
machine taboo. Working with Pasetti at the National Theater
in Munich, Linnebach accomplished the changes of <em>Das
Rheingold</em> quite as easily. In an older production at Dresden,
under Hasait, the fields of the gods opposite Valhalla were
made of bulky platforms and plastic rocks, which went rolling
back behind the cyclorama while up from the basement came
in one piece the cave of the Nibelungen with its nooks and
corners, its overhanging ceiling, and its whole equipment of
plastic canvas rocks, which might have come out of some
cavern on a scenic railway. In Munich the simpler levels of
the fields in the second scene served in the cave scene also.
They were lost in the shadows, along with the side walls,
which were hardly more than masking curtains. The rocky
cave was suggested wholly by the backdrop. This was painted
in broken, converging lines of rock formations. Because of
the magic of light, it did not seem like some conventional old
backdrop.</p>

<p>The spirit of the theater as it has developed since the war
seems to call upon the designer and <em>régisseur</em> instead of the
mechanician. When artists were building heavy and cumbersome
settings, elaborate in physical proportions if not in design,
sliding and revolving stages were unquestionably necessary,
though we may well ask how much the presence of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</span>
mechanisms tempted the artists into such excess. To-day,
however, the setting is being stylized, the stage itself made
formal. Machinery becomes irrelevant. Copeau does not
need it even for the realistic <em>Les Frères Karamazov</em>; the Redoutensaal
is almost too innocent to suspect its existence.
<em>Régisseurs</em> of the new sort want something more theatrical
than a turntable that any round-house might boast.</p>

<p>The playwright works with the <em>régisseur</em> and the artist to
this same end. While Dorothy Richardson, Waldo Frank,
and James Joyce are busy taking the machinery out of the
novel, the playwrights are making machinery unnecessary for
drama. They drop “atmosphere,” and take up the soul. They
seek the subjective instead of the physical. They want to
thrill us with the mysteries and clarities of the unconscious,
instead of cozening us with photographic detail or romantic
color. For all this they need imagination in setting, not
actuality. Form carries the spirit up and out. Indications
speak to it louder than actualities. Design, which is of the
spirit, drives out mechanism, which is of the brain.</p>

<p>The day of the machine is over in the theater, the day of
its domination at any rate. For a time it looked as though
the name of the old theater in the Tuileries would have to
be painted over every stage door in Germany—La Salle des
Machines. Now the stage machine is sinking into its proper
place—the cellar. A new device is lording it in the theater,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</span>
but it cannot be called a machine. The electric light is not
a mechanical thing. It is miraculously animated by something
very like the Life Force, and night by night its living
rays are directed to new and unforeseen ends.</p>

LIGHT AS SETTING</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">In</span> the ’eighties and the ’nineties, when electricity came
into the theater to take the place of gas, light was only
illumination. By the first decade of the twentieth century
it had become atmosphere. To-day it is taking the place
of setting in many Continental theaters. To-morrow it may
be part of drama itself.</p>

<p>In 1893 a Swiss doctor named Adolphe Appia published a
little book in French on the production of Wagner’s music-dramas;
six years later he elaborated his ideas in a volume
published in a German translation as <em>Die Musik und die Inscenierung</em>,
the first and perhaps the greatest book of theory
on the new art of the theater. Among other things, he discussed
lighting at great length. He made a very important
observation. He noted that the lighting of the stage of his
day was hardly more than mere illumination—something to
make all objects equally bright and visible. It was quite as
necessary, he believed, to make certain objects more visible
than others, and to make them more living, more dramatic.
At the time the lighting apparatus of the theater was crude, because<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</span>
the electric light was in its infancy. There were only
small electric bulbs, arranged in rows for footlights below and
borderlights overhead, to supply flat illumination, and arc
lights, which were movable and could be made to “spot” out
figures more brilliantly. Appia recognized in these last the
means for making the figure of the actor brilliant and dynamic.
With his eye on these spotlights he made an unheard-of demand.
He asked for shadows. He said that light and shade
gave three dimensions to the player and three dimensions to
the setting (provided, as he suggested, the setting be made
plastic instead of flat). By means of light he wanted to link
the living actor and the dead setting. He went further than
using shadows and animating the background. He proposed
that the play of light throughout an act should express the
mood and action. He wanted it to change with the development
of the play. He made elaborate analyses of the Wagner
music-dramas to show how the light could play a part—an
active part—in the setting and the action.</p>

<p>During the next decade, the beginning of the twentieth century,
an Italian named Fortuny began the first practical work
of progress in stage lighting. Not very permanent work, perhaps,
but certainly valuable because it struck out in new
directions. His devices have all but disappeared from the
German theater; but only because they have been replaced
by improvements along the lines he indicated. Fortuny tried<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</span>
to improve the quality of the light by using indirect illumination.
He threw light from powerful arcs against colored
bands of silk, which reflected it onto the stage. This had
two advantages. The light was diffused and broken up. The
color could be controlled at a distance by cords that moved
the various silk bands past the light. Fortuny also tried to
improve the surface on which the light fell. He devised a
domed silk sky or <em>Kuppelhorizont</em>, into which the greater part
of his diffused light was thrown, to be diffused still further.
Incidentally he hoped to achieve a better sky-effect. Disadvantages
hampered both his devices. Indirect lighting required
far more current than direct and created a great deal of
heat. The dome was produced by exhausting air from between
two curved surfaces of silk, the outer one fastened to a folding
frame of steel; creases and joints showed in the silk and air
was likely to leak in and collapse the sky.</p>

<p>In the course of another ten years engineering ingenuity supplied
substitutes for both these elements of the Fortuny System.
Most important was the discovery of how to manufacture incandescent
bulbs almost as powerful as arc lights. Such bulbs,
equipped with frosted glass and glass mediums or color screens,
could not only supply light sufficiently diffused in tone and
under easy control, but they also produced the shadows, as
well as the light, which Appia wanted. The sky-dome became
literally a fixture in the German theater when some one decided<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</span>
to make it out of plaster instead of silk. To-day the
high-powered bulb and the plaster sky are everywhere in the
German theater. Schwabe in Berlin and Phillips in Holland
have succeeded in making bulbs of the enormous power of
3,000 watts or 6,000 candle-power, bulbs about three times as
strong as any incandescent lights used in America in 1922.
The dome, or some variety of it, is found in practically every
German theater. Linnebach estimates that there are twenty
true <em>Kuppelhorizonts</em>, cupping the whole stage with a curving
dome; ten permanent <em>Rundhorizonts</em>, plaster cycloramas curving
like a great semi-circular wall around the stage; and thirty
canvas cycloramas which are quite as large as the <em>Rundhorizont</em>,
and some of which are so hung as to make a most convenient
and efficient substitute for either variety of plaster sky.</p>

<p>The most interesting and significant departures in the use
of light on the Continental stage have to do with this substitute
for the old backdrop. It began as an imitation of the sky, an
attempt to put one more piece of Realism into the theater. It
has got to the point now where its really interesting and important
uses have nothing whatever to do with realistic fake-heavens.
It is being employed as a formal element in a stage
design, or else as a surface on which to paint scenery with light.</p>

<p>Perhaps it was economy, perhaps a flash of genius, but it
occurred to the Germans that there was no particular necessity
of lighting the dome or cyclorama. In these huge stages it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</span>
stands at least sixty or seventy feet back of the footlights. It
is possible, therefore, to make it a dim emptiness by merely
turning off the lights that ordinarily shine upon it, or to give
it some vague neutral quality from the light upon the stage
which is reflected onto the <em>Horizont</em>. In <em>Othello</em> at the State
Schauspielhaus in Berlin, Jessner uses his cyclorama, an ordinary
canvas one, as a formal background bounding the space
in which his strictly conventionalized indications of settings
are placed. Thus it is in some scenes a pale neutral wall, in
some a curious violet emptiness, in others a faintly salmon
background, in still another a yellow light against which figures
move in tiny silhouettes. At the Volksbühne in <em>Masse-Mensch</em>
the dome becomes a misty void in one of the dream-scenes;
and then upon this void move vast, mysterious shadows
in circling procession.</p>

<p>Shadows on the dome carry us to a final development of
lighting in Germany—the “projection” of scenery, the substitution
of light for paint as a means of expression. Many
minds have worked and are working on devices to be used for
this purpose, but the most important mechanisms find their
home in Dresden at the theaters of Linnebach and of Hasait.</p>

<p>As might be expected, Linnebach’s is the simpler. He has
a dome in his theater, the State Schauspielhaus, and upon this
dome or through varnished silk from the back, he throws, by
means of a very simple lantern containing an arc light but no<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</span>
lenses, the designs painted on glass. This lantern and the transparent
method of projection were used in America with much
success by Lee Simonson when the New York Theater Guild
mounted Shaw’s <em>Back to Methuselah</em> in the spring of 1922.
Linnebach has made the mountains of <em>Wilhelm Tell</em> with projection
and the settings of Grabbe’s <em>Kaiser Heinrich VI</em>, and
of the expressionist dramas <em>Das Bist Du</em>, <em>Gas</em>, and <em>Jenseits</em>.</p>

<p>Hasait’s simplest method of projection brings you up sharp
against the true origins of the thing, and they are almost as
old as drama. The puppeteers of old Java had shadow-marionettes
centuries before the technical director of the Dresden
State Opera made shadow-settings. For Weber’s <em>Oberon</em> and
for Mozart’s <em>Zauberflöte</em>, Hasait provides a plastic arrangement
of inner proscenium and steps, with a translucent curtain
at the back. From one side of the curtain he projects a
design in shadows by means of a frame hardly two feet wide
across which are fastened various thicknesses of gauze. The
light that comes through the clearer portions of the gauze is
one color, while from a light on the other side of the translucent
curtain he stains the shadows with a second color. The
hue of both these lights can be changed quickly or slowly as
desired, producing harmonies and contrasts of color.</p>

<p>The other devices used by Hasait for projection are embodied
in a scheme of stage equipment called the Ars System
by the Swedish company that controls the patents for its exploitation<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</span>
abroad. The basis of the system is a canvas cyclorama.
This cyclorama runs on a semi-circular track hung
from the gridiron high above the stage. At one end of the
track is a great roller upon which the cyclorama may be wound
up, to get it out of the way during an elaborate change of
scene. It takes only half a minute for the cyclorama to be
run out on the track ready for use. The track itself may be
swung downward from its two front corners to permit particularly
large drops to be hoisted or lowered; but it is wide enough
and deep enough not to interfere with the ordinary use of the
gridiron. The cyclorama is made of common light canvas,
but it is so cut and joined, and hung on a slight slant that it
takes up of itself the bulges and wrinkles ordinarily produced
in our cycloramas by a change in weather. The invention of
this cyclorama is in dispute between those ancient but courteous
rivals, Hasait and Linnebach.</p>

<p>With this cyclorama goes an elaborate system of lighting
manufactured by Schwabe. There are floor lamps, contained
in wheeled chariots, to illuminate the bottom of the cyclorama.
Above the proscenium opening hangs a battery of different
colored lights—seventy-two in the Stockholm State
Opera—which play directly upon the cyclorama, and three
high-powered bulbs to light the stage floor. Besides these, the
Ars System, as installed at Stockholm, includes three special
projection devices also hung above the proscenium, all the adjustments<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</span>
of which are controlled electro-magnetically from
the switchboard. One of these is the large cloud-machine,
an arrangement of two tiers of eight lamps each, raying out
from a common axis. These tiers can move at different speeds
and in different directions, while each lamp can be turned up
and down and sideways at will. These projectors each house
a 6,000 candle-power bulb and hold a photograph or drawing
of a cloud. The complex motion of these static clouds when
projected on the cyclorama gives an effect of every-varying
cloud formations. Almost absolute Realism can thus be
obtained. A second and smaller and less flexible cloud-machine
with a single central lamp and reflecting mirrors is,
for some reason, included in the equipment.</p>

<p>Besides these cloud-machines there is a battery of three
high-powered bulbs and lenses, by means of which designs
painted on glass slides may be projected after the fashion of
a magic lantern upon the cyclorama or any object on the stage.
This is the really important feature of the Ars System from
an artistic standpoint. Its possibilities are extraordinary.
Harald André, chief <em>régisseur</em> of the Stockholm Opera, has
experimented little as yet with this device, utilizing it only
in one ballet. But he has speculated much on the opportunities
that it presents for uniting a large group of theaters, similarly
equipped, in the exchange of scenic designs for the
productions in their repertory. André believes that the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</span>
economy of projected scenery is important artistically, as well
as financially, because it will permit of experiment with many
new works at slight expense, and of the rapid reproduction of
the successful pieces in many cities at once.</p>

<p>From the absolute, artistic viewpoint of the effect obtained,
projection is most satisfactory, though as yet almost undeveloped.
Americans who saw the translucent projections of Simonson’s
designs in <em>Back to Methuselah</em> realized how little these
drops had the visual disadvantages of the painted variety. They
enjoyed a certain incorporeal quality. The landscapes were
not defined like huge oil paintings in false perspective. They
went into some new category which, for the moment, defeated
our analysis. Such projections may in time take on the shallow
pretense of painted backdrops, though I am inclined to
doubt it.</p>

<p class="no-indent"><em>Das Rheingold: Valhalla.</em> A setting by Linnebach
and Pasetti. The gods are grouped in deep shadow
on a conventionalized arrangement of rocky levels
in the foreground. The castle becomes slowly
visible in the sky beyond, built of beams of light,
hanging in the air like a great cumulus cloud. At
the National Theater, Munich.</p>

<br>

<p>In the case of the Valhalla of <em>Das Rheingold</em>, as projected
in Linnebach’s production at the National Theater in Munich,
the ethereal quality of this kind of “painting” again stands out.
The scene is most successful when the lighting is dimmest.
In the central portions of the second and fourth scenes, when
the stage is fully lighted, the image of Valhalla holds its own
against the illumination of the foreground, but the foreground
itself fails dismally to match the beauty of the gods’ castle.
When the plastic foreground is not to be seen, Valhalla hangs
in the heavens like one of the shapes of Wilfred’s Color Organ,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</span>a thing that seems to have three dimensions. When the lights
upon the stage floor bring out the rocks of the foreground, Valhalla
loses the reality of three dimensions. It still seems truer,
as well as more beautiful, than the rocks in front. In fact it
shows up pitilessly the trivial canvas life of those boulders.
But it loses the impression of depth, which it had at first created.
This was doubtless a false impression, a foolish illusion.</p>

<p>The projected setting is certainly in another dimension spiritually
from those two ordinarily employed in old-fashioned
scene painting. It is not in any of the planes of stage-rocks
or houses. It does not, however, war with the human figure,
curiously enough. It seems likely that the artist or director
using projected design must formalize his foreground, as
Simonson did, or else hide its commonplace actuality in shadow.
Ordinary stage pretenses cannot stand beside the spiritual plastics
produced by light.</p>

<p>As for the cloud-machine, so long as it is trying merely to
reproduce nature it is utterly unimportant. Something imaginative
must be done with it before it can expect serious consideration.
In the productions of André at the Stockholm
Opera there are at least two hints that the cloud-machine can
be used for the purposes of art. One of these, rather poorly
managed, is the use of designed clouds instead of natural clouds
in one of the scenes of <em>Samson and Delilah</em>. The other, not
perfectly executed by any means, but most suggestive, occurs<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</span>
in Verdi’s <em>Macbeth</em>. There in the first scene André sets a
wild storm sky in motion. He uses negative or black photographs
of clouds instead of positive or white, and he starts them
moving from on high and at the sides, sweeping in and down
upon the witches. As these dark shapes descend in tumult,
it seems as though the black earth were drinking black clouds,
curious and evil portent of the powers of the infernal.</p>

<p>Movement in projection has obviously great possibilities as
part of the action of new drama. In Kaiser’s expressionist
play <em>From Morn to Midnight</em>, produced by the Theater Guild,
Simonson used Linnebach’s lantern to make the tree in the
snow scene change into a skeleton, an effect that Kaiser was
able to foresee only as a shifting of snowflakes upon naked
boughs.</p>

<p>Light itself seems destined to assume a larger and larger part
in the drama. It is a playing force, quite as much as the actors.
It can be a motivator of action as well as an illuminator of it.
Jessner at the State Schauspielhaus in Berlin uses it as an
arbitrary accompaniment and interpreter of action. Lights
flash on or off as some mood changes. They create shadows
to dramatize a relation of two men. They seem to control or
to be controlled by the action. The extent to which a change
of light may express the dramatist’s conception is most interestingly
suggested in the scene of Macbeth’s death in
André’s production of the opera. It is an uncommonly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</span>
well handled scene in all respects, perhaps the best example
of this director’s fine imagination. The fight between
the armies begins in a gray light before the walls of
Dunsinane. There is no absurd effort of supers to look like
death-crazed warriors. The quality of pursuit and conflict is
caught in the pose of the bands of the soldiers as they run past
the walls bent down like dogs upon a blood-scent. Macbeth
and Macduff meet for a clear moment of conflict, then they are
surrounded and covered by the troops that rush to see their
champions do battle. At the moment when Macbeth falls,
the crowd clears for a moment. And then the grayness of
morning breaks sharply into dawn as evil goes out of the play.
An obvious symbolism, perhaps, but obviousness is not so great
a failing in the theater. The fault of the scene is only in
André’s over-emphasis upon the light, or rather his under-emphasis
upon the cause of the light—the death of Macbeth.
At the moment when the light goes on, there should come some
supreme, arresting gesture, something to absorb every atom
of our attention so that we may wonderingly discover the light
as a thing caused by Macbeth, not by an electrician.</p>

<p>Such a scene suggests wide possibilities. Light as the compelling
force of a play; light as a motivator of action; light
and setting, not as a background to action, but as part of it, as
something making characters exist and act; light as an almost
physical aura of human bodies; light, therefore, in conflict.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</span>
Physical contacts are not a necessity of the theater. Under
Jessner, the murderer of Clarence in <em>Richard III</em> does not try
to seem to stab him; he simply plunges the dagger at him.
That is enough. In <em>Francesca da Rimini</em> as Duse sometimes
gave it, I have heard that when the husband killed Paola with
his sword the space of the whole room separated them. It was
as if the sword possessed an aura, and as if the aura slew. In
<em>Masse-Mensch</em> the crowd of revolutionaries go down to the
mere rattle of machine guns before the curtains are drawn to
show the soldiers.</p>

<p>If light can do such things, even if it can do no more than
signal the downfall of evil or set Valhalla glowing in the heavens,
it will take a place in the theater that no other product
of inventive ingenuity can reach. Light, at the very least, is
machinery spiritualized.</p>

THE GERMAN ACTOR</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">Four</span> years of war left the elaborate machinery of the
German theaters intact. Four years of the purgatory
called peace have even seen a sharp advance in electrical
equipment. Critics and managers of the victorious nations
and of the neutrals that enjoy a sound exchange may complain
of the quantity and quality of theater-goers; but the
vanquished have suffered less. At forty performances in Germany
and Austria we saw hardly two rows of vacant seats all
told in the dramatic theaters, though one or two musical shows
were no more than two-thirds full.</p>

<p>The German theater has suffered, however, in one spot.
The unfortunate truth is that it is a vital spot—acting. Only
the richness of trained talent in its post-war companies enables
it to suffer the drain of the past years and still give performances
far better than we see in England or America.</p>

<p>War affected the German actor less than it did the actor in
the allied countries; Germany kept her players on the home
front fighting disheartenment. Peace and the movies, however,
brought dispersal. Companies were scattered, players
exiled.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</span>
The spectacular collapse, of course, was the dissolution of
Max Reinhardt’s famous company that filled his two Berlin
theaters. Moissi, Bassermann, Pallenberg, Konstantin, Eibenschütz,
Wegener, Dietrich, Arnold, Lehman, Eysoldt, Bertens,
Diegelmann, Heims, Jannings, Schildkraut—not one of these
names appears on the <em>Zettel</em> outside the old Reinhardt houses.
Some are in the movies and some are stars, but all are gone.</p>

<p>If American films could have entered Germany in the face
of the depreciated mark, Reinhardt’s theaters might still be
giving true repertory, Reinhardt himself might still be there,
and certainly many of the old company would be playing together
in Berlin. Other factors, personal, financial, and artistic,
gradually drew Reinhardt out of production, but he
himself declared with much truth that repertory was impossible
when actors had to give their days to the movies, instead of to
rehearsals, and that the theater was impossible for him without
repertory and actors. As for the players themselves, with the
mark at a cent and pomade at two hundred marks, it had to be
either the movies or stardom.</p>

<p>The star system of England and America, imported into
Germany, has done little to keep even the popular players in
Berlin. The audience is exhausted sooner than in New York
or London, and then tours must come. Alexander Moissi
knocks about Switzerland and Austria. Leopoldine Konstantin,
the flashing slave girl of <em>Sumurûn</em>, is supposed to be starring<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</span>
in Vienna, but you find her one night at <em>Der Blaue Vogel</em>, the
imitation <em>Chauve-Souris</em> which one of Balieff’s assistants installed
in Berlin. Pallenberg goes up and down the country
with <em>Der Wauwau</em>, the German edition of <em>Grumpy</em>.</p>

<p>Even the younger stars are wanderers. That fresh exotic,
Maria Orska, competes with the traveling troupe of the Moscow
Art Theater for the patronage of Stockholm. She plays
in the cosmopolitan German of a Russian, against the Swedish
of a resident company. The play is Wedekind’s <em>Erdgeist</em>, first
half of that staggering duology of sex which ends with <em>Pandora’s
Box</em> and Jack the Ripper, and goes under the name of
<em>Lulu</em>. In Berlin Mme. Orska is thought a little sensational.
Her Lulu is anything but that. She does not dwell on the corporeality
of this daughter of earth’s joy. Her Lulu is not a
human being made hideous and fascinating with eternal lures.
She is a kind of mask, a thin mask, a shell of tinted and whitened
silks over a face sucked dry of all but passion and the
shrunken charms of decadence. She is a sort of doll—a <em>Pritzelpuppe</em>—with
her long black legs and her pale face thrust
out from either end of a pierrot’s costume. Very much of a
doll when the play is most bitterly cruel. Dr. Goll flops to
the floor, dead, when he finds her with Schwartz. Orska
tiptoes stiffly towards him, manœuvers past his body like some
marionette, pokes him with a stiff toe and squeaks the squeak
of a doll. Is it fear or pleasure or both? A clever way to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</span>
do Wedekind. But, in the end, night after night with only
self-display to remember.</p>

<p>But Berlin—or Stockholm—is not Germany. There is
ensemble left in some of the lesser cities—there is even ensemble
in Berlin at the State Schauspielhaus, if there is no great
individual playing there.</p>

<p>The illustrious old Burgtheater in Vienna still has a company,
if it lacks a distinguished director. They manage portions
of Tolstoi’s <em>The Living Corpse</em> very well. They give the
episode of the gypsies’ singing to Fedya and Mascha as it was
never given in our own <em>Redemption</em>. In the Burgtheater it
is no discreet cabaret turn. The women and the men hang over
the lovers. Their song is a frank and touching celebration of
the love that their Mascha has won. It is an open display of
sentimental interest in love-making, which people only admit
when wine or perhaps gypsy blood have stilled inhibitions.
But all this is doubtless more a matter of direction than of acting.
It is in the old mother of Frau Senders, the aristocrats
of Frau Wilbrand and Herr Herterich, not quite so much so
in the Fedya of Herr Treszler that you find real playing.
It is hardly possible that the performance of Vildrac’s <em>The S. S.
Tenacity</em> is the best that the Burgtheater gives; but it is a
most excellent performance. It is peculiarly excellent, because,
while it is not French, it seems so little German in a
racial sense. Artistically, of course, it is most decidedly Teuton.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</span>
It has the hard, firm quality of German acting.
Copeau’s production in Paris is a rational thing; it is almost
like a reading, a very intelligent, sensitive reading. In New
York we played it in flashes of misgiving and determination;
it was unctuous in Augustin Duncan’s roustabout and in Claude
Cooper’s English sailor, and fine and sensitive in Marguerite
Forrest’s rather ladylike barmaid; but the rest dropped in and
out of illusion. The Viennese actors play for a bright and firm
actuality, which they imagine is French. It isn’t precisely
German, but technically it is as Teuton in thorough-going emotionalism
as the passionate kiss with which the Viennese players
replaced the salute on the nape of the neck with which the
French Bastien begins his wooing.</p>

<p>Individual acting as well as ensemble flourishes in the large
company that serves the four State theaters of Munich. It is
a piece of good fortune that both opera and drama are under a
single management, and that pieces may be given in any one
of four houses—the small modernist Künstler Theater of Max
Littmann in the Ausstellungspark, the tiny, wickedly cheerful
old Residenz Theater, the reformist “amphitheater” which
Littmann created in the Prinzregenten Theater, or the National
Theater, just as much the conventional old-fashioned German
opera house as when it was called the Hoftheater. The large
company and the breadth of repertory which these theaters
permit to be given efficiently and properly, provides some exceptional<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</span>
players exceptionally well-trained and in an interesting
variety of parts.</p>

<p>The Munich group can give that shock of virtuosity which
the German repertory theaters provide, and give it to you at
highest voltage. On one evening, for example, you discover
in <em>The Taming of the Shrew</em> a most exceptional Grumio. His
name is Richard Kellerhals, and he is the sort of clown that
happens once in ten years in America. He is not a Charlie
Chaplin, because that is a little too much to ask. But he outdoes
any other movie-comic that I can recall. He is not a
Jim Barton, because he does not drive ahead at just one thing—Gargantuan
burlesque. Kellerhals plays Grumio with his face
and his legs and his brain. His odd, wizened little face, inordinately
simple, just a bit loony; his acrobatic legs, quick and
comic, getting him into all manner of strange places; his brain,
always alert behind the mask of the loon, working out a dozen
amusing twists of business. It seems a highly original performance,
though perhaps it is merely tradition in Germany
that Grumio should sniff the clothes of Biondello, and be
sniffed at, all within the bounds of decency, but very like two
dogs of their masters. At any rate, original or not, it is the
sort of sharp, brilliant fooling that would make Kellerhals a
musical comedy specialist in America, perhaps a star.</p>

<p>An evening or two later, out at the Ausstellungspark you see
Hauptmann’s play of the Peasants’ Rebellion, <em>Florian Geyer</em>.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</span>
Almost the first figure you notice among the peasants who are
trying desperately to make themselves far-seeing leaders in the
fight against the trained nobles, is a gaunt fellow with his head
in a bloody bandage, and with fever in his eyes. This is Geyer’s
brother-in-law and secretary in the field, a boy almost on the
point of death who looks like a sickened man of thirty. The
desperate impatience of the worn is mingled in his face with
the fanatical devotion of the men who win lost causes. The
cause <em>is</em> lost in the end, and after he has watched this disillusion
pile upon quarrels and jealousies and treasons, he crumples up
and dies. Every word of his tragedy you can read in his face.
When you look at your program you find that the name of the
actor is Richard Kellerhals. In America—if Kellerhals had
acted this part before Grumio—he would be competing with
William B. Mack in the playing of tortured gunmen the rest
of his life.</p>

<p>Quite as good acting and almost as varied impersonations are
to be seen in the work of Friedrich Ulmer as Petruchio and as
Geyer. His Geyer—strong, simple, desperate in anger—is
easy to imagine on our stage; Lionel Barrymore could do it.
But his Petruchio—a coarse, bull-necked, and most amusing
devil—is another matter. It sins against the pretty romance
of our Van Dyked Shakespeare. And it is famously good fun,
along with the whole riotous show.</p>

<p>Dresden has a company that makes no difficulty over playing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</span>
Shaw’s <em>Pygmalion</em> one night, in German provincial accents
that are supposed to approximate the English dialects pursued
and recorded by Professor Higgins under the portico of Covent
Garden, and over playing the next night a comic and poetic
romance of India called <em>Vasantasena</em> by a king called Sudraka.
Here the women come out rather more sharply than most of
the men, two fine performances in particular by Melitta Leithner
as Eliza, the flower girl, and Alice Verden as Vasantasena.
The company cannot escape, however, a beefy German tenor-hero,
one of the sort that seems in danger any moment of turning
into a leading woman with a heavy beard.</p>

<p>Frankfort has perhaps less real acting talent than is to be
found in any of the State theaters of the larger cities. It shows
an atrocious performance of <em>Peer Gynt</em>. Yet, given direction
such as Richard Weichert furnishes in Schiller’s <em>Maria Stuart</em>,
and it seems a company of genius. Carl Ebert, a bad Peer
Gynt, manages a Leicester of real subtlety; the Elizabeth of
Gerda Müller seems a tempestuous horror, and the whole
thing is lighted by many excellent small bits of acting.</p>

<p>There seems to be a certain hard, uncompromising insistence
in all German acting. It is a thing, perhaps, of narrow spirit
and deep intensity. It has unquestioned vitality. In Grabbe’s
old drama, <em>Napoleon</em>, which Jessner gives at the State Schauspielhaus
in Berlin, this vitality leaps to union most happily
with the intoxication that Bonaparte spread about him always,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</span>
and never more extraordinarily than in the Hundred Days
which this play chronicles. It is all vitality, the impatient
vitality of the soldiers of Wolfgang Heinz and Lothar Müthel,
who await Napoleon’s return, the besotted and sinister vitality
of the new mob of the <em>carmagnole</em>, the energizing vitality of
Rudolf Forster’s Wellington, the sober, slow but potent
vitality of Arthur Krauszneck’s Blücher, and that font of indomitable
self-assertion Napoleon himself, played by Ludwig
Hartau. Even the old Humpty-Dumpty Louis of Leopold von
Ledebur, and the courtiers who prop him up on his throne
take on a certain fixity of purpose—perhaps a deathly fixity—from
the vitality flowing round them.</p>

<p>In other performances of Jessner’s company this vitality
flows over into mere vigor, even into violence. That is the
besetting sin of the German actor. Fritz Kortner, celebrated
for his Richard III and his Othello, ranges from unnatural
suppression of feeling, from studied and almost whispered
restraint, to mad screechings. An almost neurotic violence
crops up somewhere in every other performance in Germany.
Even the women fall into it. Gerda Müller’s Elizabeth, after
an evening of excellent, mastered power, breaks out into the
hoarse-voiced raving that seems more a mark of the male
players. Sudden spurts of laying it on too thick appear in some
of the secondary players of <em>Florian Geyer</em>. The comic villain
of <em>Vasantasena</em> plays the whole thing in a knot of petty passion.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</span>
It is ranting, this sort of thing, no matter how far it may
be from the orotund mouthings of our old-school players, no
matter how much sharp characterization and genuine passion
may be forced into it.</p>

<p>The performance of <em>Masse-Mensch</em> at the Volksbühne in
Berlin stands out because it manages to carry intensity of feeling
to a point just short of violence, and then, with every
excuse provided in this desperate story of thwarted revolution,
to bring it up short at the right moment into high-pitched but
beautiful vehemence. The outstanding impression must be
the astounding diction of the mob that speaks clearly, rhythmically,
and most movingly with a single common voice; it gives
you a sudden vision of what the Greek chorus may have been,
and why thirty thousand people listened. But the power of
Mary Dietrich as the Christ-figured, Christ-tortured woman
is almost as unforgettable.</p>

<p>Looking back across these forty-odd performances, I find
that a very simple and very brief bit of acting stands out as
sharply as any. It is the quiet, sadly amusing, little Buddhist
priest in <em>Vasantasena</em> as played by Erich Ponto. It is not a
thing the German stage often discloses, this delicate mingling
of humor and reverence. If it were, the people from Moscow
who played <em>The Cherry Orchard</em> would not have seemed to
come from the one land where acting is a rounded and tempered
perfection.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_VIII">CHAPTER VIII<br>
NEW ACTING FOR OLD</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">Acting</span> is the oldest thing in the theater. It comes
before the play, because in the beginning the actor
and the playwright are one. Drama originates when
two or three people are seized with a desire to give an old
legend or an old ritual a living form. They want to act. As
they act they make up their play. The theater becomes the
spot that seems a good place—either spiritually, physically,
or by force of tradition—in which to give the play. In time
comes a division of labor. One of the actors begins to specialize
on the play. This actor studies how he can develop the
form of the play to make better use of the theater; and then,
with some leader among the actors, he begins to speculate on
how to change the theater in order to give more scope to the
playwright and to the player who interprets him.</p>

<p>That is the history of the theater through twenty-five centuries.
It begins with the actor, and it comes very close to
ending with him.</p>

<p>It is rather a good thing to understand about the history
of the theater. It gives you a certain respect for the actor<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</span>
which actors do not always inspire. It makes you patient with
the difficulties of writing anything intelligible on this most
ancient and most complex and most unsubstantial of all the
things of the theater. It makes you realize the dangers of
dogmatizing on the subject. And, if you can look back with
imagination to the day of Garrick and his great apron stage
and his Hamlet in knickerbockers, back to the day of Burbage
and his sunlit platform in the midst of an Elizabethan mob,
back to Æschylus answering the chorus of the Furies in the
half circle of Athenians that piled up the hillside of the Acropolis;
perhaps, then, you will see that the actor was not always
a fellow with a false beard or the manners of a soda water
clerk, who expects you to believe that he is no actor at all,
but a family doctor or an employee of Mr. Liggett who has
taken to living in a room with one side gone. At any rate
a little hint of theatrical history, full of amazing surprises,
might make you tolerant of such speculations as the following
on the four types of acting to be seen in the theater to-day and
on what is to come of them.</p>

<p>The art of acting is a miscellaneous sort of art. I imagine
that types of acting which we think very new and modern
were to be found in every age except the first. Probably some
famous Greek comedian made his entrance in <em>The Frogs</em>
looking so amazingly like the statue of Herakles on the Acropolis
that for half a minute nobody could be sure that this was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</span>
really the actor whom they had expected to see. In Shakespeare’s
day it is not unlikely that the man who played Caliban
got together a collection of false hair and wooden tusks which
made every one wonder who the new member of the company
could be. And probably among the Greeks and the Elizabethans
there were players so amazingly like servants or kings
in face and carriage that they never played anything else. Yet
it is safe to say, nevertheless, that the actor’s trick of trying
to look like a different human being in each new play and
never at all like himself, and his other trick of never looking
like anything but himself and always playing exactly the same
kind of part, are histrionic symptoms of the disease called
Realism. There was never so much literal and deliberate impersonation
as in Europe to-day, and so much “type casting”
as along Broadway.</p>

<p>These are two very different methods of work, but they
both reach the same end—absolute resemblance—and neither
has necessarily anything to do with art. The first—for which
the word “impersonation” is commonly and very loosely used—is
pretty generally esteemed to-day. It is considered to mark
off the actor, even the artist, from the crowd of clever
mummers. It is hard to deny an instant and hearty interest
in any player who can look like and act like a tramp one
night, and like a barbaric king the next. The emotion he
creates as a king, or the artist’s vision he displays in selecting<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</span>
his material and making Form out of it, may be great or small.
But his ingenuity in masquerade will always win admiration.
In fact we are pretty sure to spend our time praising such an
actor as Ben-Ami for looking like a neurotic artist in <em>Samson
and Delilah</em>, and like a husky young horse-thief in <em>The Idle
Inn</em>, instead of recognizing the artistic distinction these impersonations
show.</p>

<p>Examined in cold blood, the virtue of this sort of acting
is the virtue of the wig-maker. The difference between a
Van Dyke and a pair of mutton chops; the difference between
Flesh Color No. 1 and Flesh Color No. 3; the difference
between a waiter’s dress suit bought on the Bowery, and a
doublet designed by James Reynolds and made by Mme. Freisinger—that
is the secret of this kind of acting. Not the whole
secret, of course, for the pose of the actor’s body, the grace or
awkwardness of his carriage, the lift of an eyebrow, or the
droop of a lip is quite as important. Such things, however,
have no more of art or emotion in them than the tricks of
make-up. They can give us recollections of real persons or
figures in literature, in painting, or in other plays, about whom
we have felt emotion. But it is not until the actor puts Form
of his own into this lay figure, by the movement of his body,
and the emotion of his voice, that anything approaching art
can be said to exist.</p>

<p>Stanislavsky may look like a colonel in <em>The Three Sisters</em>,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</span>
and like a spineless gentleman in <em>The Cherry Orchard</em>; but that
is not the measure of his art. Stanislavsky might even <em>be</em> a
colonel on leave who took a fancy to acting, or a spineless
gentleman who lost his patrimony and fell back on his university
reputation as an amateur actor; and he would still have
to prove himself an artist.</p>

<p>There is an amusing similarity and contrast between the
two varieties of realistic actors. The first impersonates a different
character in every play, and never himself. The second
impersonates the same character in every play and always
himself. The first impersonates by changing; the second by
remaining the same.</p>

<p>Provided that there is a large and varied supply of types—military
men, bar-keeps, politicians, artist-neurotics, criminal-neurotics,
he-men, she-men, rabbit-men, not to mention all
sorts of women—the result on a play should not be so very
different whichever system of acting is adopted. If a play-goer
were to see only one play, he couldn’t detect any difference.
If he were to see two, he would be likely to get some added
pleasure out of the knowledge that the same people were acting
both, and he would probably use up on the business of
spying out the tricks of it all a good deal of the energy and
attention that he ought to give to the play.</p>

<p>There is one practical difference, however, in these two
ways of casting a play. You cannot make a repertory company<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</span>
out of types. In spite of the old jargon about Leading Man,
Leading Woman, Juvenile, Old Man, Ingenue, Heavy, Character
Man, and so forth, no permanent company giving realistic
plays can get along without actors who can achieve some
sort of differentiation. Since the German theater and most of
the European theater is run on the repertory system, the Continental
actor is generally a man adept in masquerade. Because
America has no repertory theater, because producers in New
York pick new actors out of the apple barrel for every new
play, and because almost all the legitimate actors of America
make New York their headquarters, the system of casting by
type is the natural, workable system for us.</p>

<p>Type acting need not mean that the type the actor plays
is absolutely identical with his own personality in private life.
It usually isn’t. But it does mean that, because of his own
personality, his physical and mental equipment, the actor is
able to play a very similar type to his own. Two excellent
examples of this are Frank Craven and Ernest Truex. In
real life they are never Tommy Tucker of <em>The First Year</em> or
the hero of <em>Six Cylinder Love</em>, but on the stage they are never
anything else. It is just possible that they could be something
else, but they began this way, and this way the managers
and the public will probably make them continue.</p>

<p>All of which brings up a single artistic point upon which
varied impersonations and the repertory theater defeat type<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</span>
casting. Type casting is apt to tie a man to the kind of part
he first acts with any ability, and not the kind he can act best.
He may be able to play ten different sorts of characters, and
one or two of these may release something in him that permits
him to be a true artist in his impersonation. But if he happens
to play some other of the ten characters first, and play
it reasonably well, our casting system may keep him from ever
reaching those characters in which he might excel. For another
thing, the constant change of parts in a repertory theater
gives an actor practice that he cannot get if he repeats type
parts in fewer plays, as he must do in America. Through this
practice with varying parts, he may come to add something
of artistic significance to his work.</p>

<p>A nice esthetic point arises if you find a type-actor—say
Craven—giving an extraordinarily good performance. He
is playing himself, we will say; yet within that familiar personality,
he is achieving just as interesting emotion as some
other actor of a different personality, but possessing the knack
of varied impersonation, could achieve; he is even reaching
a sense of Form, selecting out of his own personality, experience,
and emotion, and combining these into a shape that
moves us esthetically—whether to laughter or to tears. Is
this art? Would it be art if the actor were Georgie Price imitating
Craven, or somebody from the Moscow Art Theater
impersonating Craven? Would it be art if Craven played a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</span>
character so different from himself as the <em>savant</em> in <em>He Who
Gets Slapped</em>, and played it as successfully as he has played
Tommy Tucker? Unquestionably the answer to the last question
would be Yes. As for the others, there is legitimate room
for argument.</p>

<p>This business of varied impersonation <em>versus</em> self-impersonation
arouses a great deal of dispute. The most interesting feature
of the squabble is that usually the opponent of self-impersonation
or type-acting points back with mournful pride to
some of the great actors of the past like Booth or Forrest.
When he does this, he passes clean outside of realistic acting.
Moreover, he brings into the argument actors, who, while they
played a wide variety of parts, never took the trouble to hide
behind the wig-maker or to pretend to be anybody else physically
than the great Edwin Booth or the celebrated Edwin
Forrest.</p>

<p>To-day we have this same kind of acting, I imagine—and
this is the third kind that I want to list—in the work of Sarah
Bernhardt, Giovanni Grasso, Margaret Anglin, or Clare Eames.
If you started out to list the players who use their own mask
frankly for every part, achieving impersonation and emotion
by their use of features and voice as instruments, you would
find many more names of women than of men; for the actress
has far fewer opportunities than the actor to employ the ingenuities
of make-up. You would also find, I think, that your<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</span>
list was not so very long, and that it contained the names of
most of the players of great distinction from Eleanora Duse
to Charlie Chaplin. There is magic in the soul of such
players, not in their make-up boxes. They create their impersonations
before your eyes, not in their dressing rooms. You
may, perhaps, be tempted to say that their art lies in the
voice, that the face is a mask. But the face is obviously
not a permanent mask; it changes not only from character to
character in many subtle ways, but from scene to scene, and
emotion to emotion. Also, there is Chaplin, the voiceless;
his face speaks. It seems a mask, too, but it is articulate.</p>

<p>Such acting may be given—and usually is given—to the interpretation
of realistic drama. It belongs at heart to another
thing, to almost another age, past or to come. It achieves
the necessary resemblance through the inner truth of its art.
But it never submits to submergence. It reaches out towards
a kind of acting that we used to have and that we will have
again, while it meets the necessities of Realism.</p>

<p>This fourth kind of acting may be called presentational—a
word that derives its present use from a distinction set up
by Alexander Bakshy in his <em>The Path of the Russian Stage</em>.
Presentational acting, like presentational production, stands in
opposition to representational. The distinction is clear enough
in painting, where a piece of work that aims to report an
anecdote, or to photograph objects, is representational, and a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</span>
piece of work striving to show the relation of forms which
may or may not be of the everyday world, is presentational.
In the theater Bakshy makes a parallel distinction
between a scenic background that attempts to represent with
canvas and paint actual objects of wood or rock or whatnot,
and a background that presents itself frankly as what it is—curtains,
for instance, or an architectural wall. The distinction
applies to acting as well. A Broadway actor in a bald wig
or an actor naturally bald, who is trying to pretend that he is
in a room off in Budapest, and who refuses to admit that he
knows it is all a sham, and that a thousand people are watching
him, is a representational actor, or a realist. An actor who
admits that he is an actor, and that he has an audience before
him, and that it is his business to charm and move this audience
by the brilliance of his art, is a presentational actor.
The difference deserves better terms, but they do not yet exist.</p>

<p>It is obvious enough that the first actors were presentational.
The Greek men who shouted village gossip from the wains,
and made plays of it, were villagers known to every one. The
actors in the first dramatic rituals may have worn masks, but
they were frankly actors or priests, not the gods and heroes
themselves. Roscius was Roscius, Molière was Molière; even
the Baconians cannot deny that Shakespeare was Shakespeare
when he appeared as old Adam. I would maintain that Garrick
and Siddons, Talma and Rachel were frankly actors; did<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</span>
they not see the audience out there under the light of the
same chandeliers that lit their stage?</p>

<p>To-day our greatest players reëstablish to some extent the
bond with the audience when they abandon any attempt to
represent their characters through wigs and make-up, and
present their own faces frankly as vehicles of expression. In
comedy and in tragedy presentational acting comes out most
easily. There is something in really great sorrow—not the
emotions of the thwarted defectives of our realistic tragedies—that
leaps out to an audience. Hecuba must speak her sorrow
to the chorus and over the chorus to the people who have
come to the theater for the single purpose of hearing it. There
can be no fitting communion with the characters who have
caused the tragedy or been stricken by it. The sufferer must
carry her cup of sorrow to the gods; they alone can drink of it
and make it less. And the great fact of the theater is that the
audience are gods. It is a healthy instinct that causes many an
actress in a modern tragedy to turn her back on the other characters
of the play, and make her lamentation to the audience as
though it were a soliloquy or an aside.</p>

<p>There are gods and gods, of course, and it is to Dionysus and
Pan that the comedian turns when he shouts his jokes out across
the footlights. In fact he takes good care, if he is a wise clown,
that the footlights shan’t be there to interfere. If he is Al
Jolson, he insists on a runway or a little platform that will bring<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</span>
him out over the footlights and into the lap of the audience. If
he is a comedian in burlesque like Bobbie Clark, he has the
house lights turned up as soon as he begins a comedy scene.
He must make contact somehow with his audience. If
the fun-maker is Fanny Brice, the method is a little less
obvious, and it draws us closer to the sort of presentational
acting which will dominate many theaters in the future, the
sort of acting that presents an impersonation, and at the same
time stands off with the audience, and watches it. If the
player is Ruth Draper or Beatrice Herford, you have something
that seems to me almost identical with the kind of acting
I am trying to define.</p>

<p>I present these four categories of acting for what they are
worth. They are frankly two-dimensional. They are divisions
in a single plane. Other planes cut across them, and the
categories in these planes intersect the ones I have defined.
Consider almost any player, and you will find a confusion of
methods and results which will need more explanation than I
have provided. There is Richard Kellerhals, for instance, the
Munich player whose strikingly different work in <em>The Taming
of the Shrew</em> and <em>Florian Geyer</em> I have described. This is not
impersonation achieved with make-up. It is a thing of expression,
a spiritual thing. Take the actors of the Moscow Art
Theater. They use make-up to the last degree, but there is
always a spiritual differentiation far more significant than the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</span>
physical, and there is always a sense of the Form of life more
important than either. Harry Lauder has one impersonation—The
Saftest of the Family—which is so different from his
others in almost every way that for the moment he might be a
different player. Here is a presentational actor indulging in
the tricks of the realistic impersonator, and showing that,
while the fields of realistic impersonation and presentational
acting are not absolutely exclusive, at least they are somewhat
incongruous or at any rate mutually hampering. Louis Jouvet
of the Théâtre du Vieux-Colombier presents an opposite phenomenon
when he appears in the realistic drama <em>Les Frères
Karamazov</em> as the horrific old father, Feodor, and in <em>Twelfth
Night</em> as Aguecheek. These are absolutely contradictory impersonations.
In each case Jouvet completely disguises his
own personality. The interesting point is that the physical
impersonation which he brings to the Russian play is essentially
unrealistic. It is all very carefully designed in costume, make-up,
and gesture as a broad and striking expression, but not as a
representation, of rough dominance. The red face and the
green coat mix in the olive-bronze hat. His hair and his hat,
his coat and his elbows flare out in lines of almost comic violence.
He is very close to caricature in a thoroughly realistic
play. Here is a curious mixture of methods and ends—planes
and categories cutting across one another and creating new
figures.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</span></p>

<p>Copeau’s Vieux-Colombier is to-day the most interesting
forcing bed of the new acting in Europe—unless the Kamerny
Theater of the Russian expressionists is nourishing more than
scenery. Copeau’s theater, with its naked stage and almost permanent
architectural setting, its lack of proscenium and footlights,
and its steps and forestage leading down to the audience,
makes unquestionably for presentational acting. The illusion
of Realism and representation is extremely difficult to attain.
In four plays, <em>Les Frères Karamazov</em>, <em>Twelfth Night</em>, <em>The S. S.
Tenacity</em>, and <em>Le Carrosse du St.-Sacrement</em>, varied as they are,
we see no great amount of the sort of masquerading which
Jouvet does so well in the first two. In the main, the actors keep
their own normal appearance throughout; but they are not, of
course, playing types. To some extent, therefore, they are
working in the vein of Bernhardt and Grasso, striving for impersonation
in emotion rather than in physique. Except for a
gouty foot and a simple change in costume, Copeau’s Peruvian
governor in the comedy <em>Le Carrosse du St.-Sacrement</em>, and his
impersonation of the intellectual brother of the house of Karamazov
are outwardly very much alike. It is in the mood alone
that he registers the difference. In both, but particularly in
the comic governor, there is a touch of the presentational attitude
which fills the rest of the company in varying degrees
and informs most of <em>Twelfth Night</em>. The difference between
this acting and what we are accustomed to, is particularly plain<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</span>
in a comparison of the English sailor as played in the New
York production of <em>The S. S. Tenacity</em>, and in the Paris production—the
oily reality of Claude Cooper’s impersonation against
the rather brash, certainly very dry version of Robert Allard.
Allard’s performance has the stamp of almost all the acting at
the Vieux-Colombier. It is something intellectually settled
upon as an expression of an emotion, and then conveyed to the
audience almost as if read and explained. In the school of
Copeau, who was once journalist and critic, there is ever something
of the expounder. It is a reading, an explanation, in the
terms of a theatrical performance. It is, to a certain degree,
presentational, because in every reading, in every explanation,
there must be an awareness of the existence of the audience.</p>

THE REINHARDT TRADITION</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">Plays</span> of a new expressionist quality—profound, grave,
ecstatic, and as far from the neurotic as from the
realistic—may be written in the next few years without
the stimulus of a great expressionist theater or a great expressionist
director. How they are going to get themselves
properly produced is another matter. They may be conceived
out of the spirit of the time, under the stimulus of the expressionist
settings of the scene designers; but the <em>accouchement</em>
will demand a rather expert midwife.</p>

<p>Expressionist acting, on the contrary, will never achieve
more than a hint of existence without a director to call it forth.
A Copeau is necessary to bring out the freshness of the company
of the Vieux-Colombier, and the hints it gives of the new
acting. A rather extraordinary director will be needed to
banish representational acting, and to put in its place a presentational
ensemble, and to fuse it with the new play.</p>

<p>Is there such a man in Europe to-day? Is there already an
indication of his coming in the modifications that other men
have wrought in acting, in setting, and even in theater?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</span></p>

<p>We may as well begin with Reinhardt. He has been the
greatest man of the theater of this century. He fled from his
Berlin theaters in 1920, to find in Salzburg a retreat from disillusion
and a place of new beginnings. We found him there
in the summer of 1922 preparing to issue forth from the
baroque beauty of the loveliest palace of this lovely city to
the conquest of America, and to an experiment in Vienna which
may make him again the one figure of the theater—the director
we seek. And here and there about Europe we came on
spasmodic signs of his continued activity—extraordinary plans
for a <em>Festspielhaus</em> in Salzburg or in Geneva, and productions
of <em>Orpheus in the Underworld</em> and Strindberg’s <em>The Dream
Play</em> in Stockholm.</p>

<p>It would be better, perhaps, to call <em>Orpheus</em> and <em>The Dream
Play</em> efficient pot-boilers, and to let them go at that. They
give no true measure of the man whose strength and vision
grew from art-cabarets to which Balieff owes the inspiration
for his <em>Chauve-Souris</em>, and naturalistic beginnings with Gorky
and Wedekind, until he had assembled the most striking company
and repertory west of Moscow, and centered about himself
the whole theatrical movement which Craig and Appia
began. The Swedish productions are worth a moment’s attention
only, for they show some of Reinhardt’s faults, and hint
at a virtue.</p>

<p>I write of <em>Orpheus</em> alone, because the qualities of the Strindberg<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</span>
drama were only to be guessed at from photographs and
reports, all uniting in dispraise. There were lovely things in
this performance of Offenbach’s operetta for which neither
director nor composer could claim credit—the light, clear,
nightingale voices of the women of the Swedish Opera, their
superb figures, and the icy beauty of blue eyes and ashen hair.
But the things I remember from <em>Orpheus</em> in which Reinhardt
had a share are often disappointing things, scenes slighted, episodes
badly lit, above all carelessness of detail. It has been
Reinhardt’s major fault, this failure to bring every feature of
a production to the highest point of perfection within his grasp.
He has always been satisfied to slight one part if the whole could
be “put over” by emphasis on another part. Those who remember
<em>Sumurûn</em> will recall things in this brilliantly exciting
pantomime that struck them as impossibly slack—bad painting
on the canvas flats, a bald contrast between the flimsy front
scenes and the solid structure of the court of the harem behind.</p>

<p>In <em>Orpheus</em> his negligence seems to have begun in the choice
of a designer. A Dane, Max Rée, makes a mess of the scene
on Olympus, and gets to nothing better elsewhere than a golden
gate from a chapel in Nancy set against a blue night; Cupid
against a gray sky, and, for the descent into Hades, white rays
from out a great cloud, down one of which the company dances
against the velvet black of the back drop. Before now, Reinhardt
has let himself wander from his first instincts and desires—which
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</span>are usually the instincts of Ernst Stern, his notable
designer; there are the horrors of Poelzig’s decoration of the
Grosses Schauspielhaus to testify to this.</p>

<br>

<p>The three moments of <em>Orpheus</em> which electrified Swedish
audiences are common enough in conception, but they have
something of the simple directness and smash which characterized
Reinhardt’s earlier work. The three episodes are closely
linked and make the climax of the piece. There again you
can see Reinhardt’s method—the expenditure of so much of
his care and energy upon the most important action of the
play. In <em>Orpheus</em> the place for such emphasis is the revolt
on Mt. Olympus, and the descent of Jupiter and the gods to
Hades. Reinhardt begins with the <em>carmagnole</em> of the revolutionists,
with their red banners upon long poles rioting about
in the light blue of the celestial regions. For the beginning of
the descent into Hades, Reinhardt sees to it that there shall be
a high point at the very back of the stage, and from here, clear
down to the footlights and over them on a runway beside the
boxes, he sends his gods and goddesses cakewalking two at a
time down into the depths of the orchestra pit. After a very
brief darkness, while the cloud and its rays of light are installed
down stage, Reinhardt sets the gods prancing down this white
and black path into the flaming silk mouth of hell. By recognizing
an opportunity for an effect at the crucial point of the
piece, and concentrating upon it whatever energies he has for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</span>
<em>Orpheus</em>, he makes the descent of the gods far more memorable
than it can have been in any other production. Yet it all seems
a trivial and half-hearted effort for the man who made Shakespeare
so tremendously vital at the Deutsches Theater, and
lifted Sophocles’ <em>Œdipus</em> into crashing popularity at the Circus
Schumann.</p>

<p>In his day Reinhardt was all things to all men. He began
with the great naturalist director Brahm of the Freie Volksbühne.
He made a <em>Night Lodging</em> of utter Realism. He
put on <em>A Midsummer Night’s Dream</em> in a forest of <em>papier-mâché</em>.
He brought an austere symbolic quality to <em>Hamlet</em>,
closing the play with those tall, tall spears that shepherded
the body of the Dane upon its shield. He made the story of
Sister Beatrice into a gigantic and glorious spectacle in <em>The
Miracle</em>. He championed intimacy in the theater, took the
actor out upon a runway over the heads of the audience in
<em>Sumurûn</em> and finally, at the Grosses Schauspielhaus, he put the
spectators half around the players, and thrust the players in
among the spectators in the last scene of Rolland’s <em>Danton</em>.</p>

<p>Instinct led him to the heart of plays, as it led him from
Realism and the proscenium frame back to the Greek orchestra
and the actor as a theatrical figure. He grasped the emotional
heart of a drama with almost unerring judgment, and he
bent a tremendous energy to the task of making the heart of
the audience beat with it. Occasionally he ignored or could<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</span>
not animate some secondary but important phase of a play.
In <em>The Merchant of Venice</em>, though he made Shylock rightly
the center of the play and built up a court scene of intolerable
excitement, his Portia and his Nerissa were tawdry figures.
But his successes were far greater and far more significant than
his failures. <em>Romeo and Juliet</em> he made into a thing of youthful
passion that was almost too deep, too intimate for the eyes
of strangers. <em>Hamlet</em> with Moissi was an experience of life
itself, asserting again the emotional quality of Reinhardt as
against the esthetic quality of Craig.</p>

<p>It is hardly necessary to speak of the part that Reinhardt
played in establishing the vogue of the designer in the theater,
of his attempt to bring Craig to his stage, of his experiments
with stage machinery and lighting equipment, or of the extraordinary
personal energy which made so much work possible.
The German theater testifies continually to his influence.
Dozens of younger men must be working in his vein to-day.
As far north as Gothenburg, the commercial city of Sweden,
and as far south as Vienna his influence spreads.</p>

<p>In Gothenburg works a young director, Per Lindberg, who
is as patently a disciple as he was once a student of Reinhardt.
There in the Lorensberg Theater is the revolving stage, with
settings by a young Swede, Knut Ström, which might have
been seen at the Deutsches Theater ten years ago. A large
repertory brings forth scenery often in the heavily simplified<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</span>
fashion of ten years ago, but sometimes fresh and ambitious.
<em>Romeo and Juliet</em> appears against scenes like early Italian
paintings, with one permanent background of hill and cypresses
and a number of naïve arrangements of arched arcades from
some Fra Angelico. The artist turns <em>régisseur</em> also in <em>Everyman</em>,
and manages a performance fresh in its arrangement of
setting, platforms, and steps, if a little reminiscent in costumes
and poses and movements.</p>

<p>In Richard Weichert, of the State Schauspielhaus in Frankfort,
you find a <em>régisseur</em> who suggests the influence of Reinhardt
without losing distinction as one of the three really significant
directors of Germany to-day. It is not so much an
influence in an imitative sense, as a resemblance in effectiveness
along rather similar lines.</p>

<br>

<p>Weichert, like so many of the outstanding directors of Germany,
has a single artist with whom he works on terms of the
closest coöperation—Ludwig Sievert. It is a little hard, therefore,
to divide the credit in <em>Maria Stuart</em> for many of the
dramatic effects of people against settings and in light. You
might put down the scenic ideas wholly to Sievert, since
Weichert has permitted the use of a particularly poor setting
for the scene of Queen Mary’s tirade against Elizabeth; a
setting which is a sloppy attempt at lyricism in keeping with
Mary’s speech at the beginning of the scene, but quite out of
touch with the dramatic end. If Weichert could dictate the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</span>fine prison scene reproduced in this book, he would hardly allow
Sievert to include the greenery-yallery exterior to which I
have taken exception. On the other hand, can it be only an
accidental use that Weichert makes of the curtains in the
throne room scene? The act begins with a curious arrangement
of square blue columns in an angle of which the throne
is set. When the audience is over, pages draw blue curtains
from each side of the proscenium diagonally backward to the
columns by the throne. This cuts down the room to terms of
intimacy for the council scene. The point at which Weichert
must enter definitely as <em>régisseur</em> comes when Elizabeth steps
to one side of the room away from her group of councilors
to read some document; then the down-stage edge of the curtain
at the side by the councilors is drawn back far enough for
a flood of amber light to strike across in front of the men, and
catch the white figure of the queen. Here in this light she
dominates the room; and Leicester, when he steps into it for
a scene with Mortimer, does the same. It is a device of great
use to the actor in building up the power and atmosphere of
the moment.</p>

<p>The dramatic vigor of Weichert never goes so high in <em>Maria
Stuart</em> as Reinhardt’s, but he is never so careless of detail or of
subordinate scenes. Almost every inch of the play seems painstakingly
perfected. Not only are the actors who give so sloppy
a performance in <em>Peer Gynt</em> under another director, strung up<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</span>
constantly to their best effort; but every detail, from contrasts
in costuming and the arrangement of costumed figures, to the
motion of hands and bodies, seems calculated to heighten the
play’s emotion. Take the first scene, for example, the prison
in which Queen Mary is confined with her few retainers. The
drawing shows the interesting arrangement of the scene with
bars to indicate a prison but not to obstruct action. It pictures
the final scene in a later act, when the queen receives her friends
and says good-by before going to her death. The contrast of
the queen in white and the others in black is excellent. In the
first act, even the queen is in black; the only note of color, a
deep red, is given to the heroic boy, Mortimer, who is to bring
something like hope to Mary. The long scene between Mortimer
and the queen is handled with great dignity, and at the
same time intensity. It is studied out to the last details. The
hands alone are worth all your attention.</p>

<p>Weichert’s direction passes on from atmosphere and movement
to the expression that the players themselves give of their
characters. It is here perhaps that the resemblance to Reinhardt
is closest. You catch it in many places: the contrast between
Mortimer’s tense young fervor, and the masterful, play-acting
nonchalance of Leicester; this red and green horror of
an Elizabeth, looking somehow as bald beneath her wig as

<p>This is the past of Reinhardt—continued into the present
and the future by other men. What of his own continuation
of it? Some have thought him finished. Fifteen, twenty
years of such accomplishment in the theater are likely to drain
any man. And indeed Reinhardt does seem to have run
through his work in Berlin, and finished with it. No one will
know just how much was personal, how much professional,
how much philosophic, in the force that drove him to give
up the leadership of his great organization, and see it destroyed.
The difficulties of management, with increasing costs and
actors lost to the movies, undoubtedly weighed heavily. But
it is certain that he felt the failure of his big, pet venture, the
Grosses Schauspielhaus. It was to have been the crown of
his efforts and beliefs—the “theater of the five thousand,” as
he had called it from the days when he astounded the world
with <em>Œdipus</em>. In structure and design it was badly handled;
it proved a bastard thing and won the severe condemnation
of the critics. Added to this was a desire, unquestionably,
to shake loose, to get a fresh prospect on the theater, to strike
out again if possible towards a final, sure goal. Germans<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</span>
spoke of Reinhardt as vacillating and uncertain in his first years
in Salzburg. But is anything but uncertainty to be expected
when a man has given up a long line of effort, and is
seeking a new one? It is a virtue then to be unsure, to be testing
and trying the mind, to be seeking some sort of truth and
repeatedly rejecting error.</p>

<p>Certainty began to creep in with Reinhardt’s plan for a
<em>Festspielhaus</em> in Salzburg—a Grosses Schauspielhaus of simpler
and more conservative pattern built truer on a knowledge of
the mistakes of the first. It was to unite Reinhardt, Richard
Strauss, the composer, and Hugo von Hofmannsthal, the playwright.
It reached some sort of tentative plan at the hands
of Poelzig, who mis-designed the Grosses Schauspielhaus, and
Adolf Linnebach, then passed on to Max Hasait, who laid out
a stage scheme for some new architect to build his plans around.
This scheme called for a semi-circular forestage, with a revolving
stage in its center, a traveling cyclorama of the Ars pattern
behind this revolving stage, a larger cyclorama taking in still a
deeper stage, and another and a larger cyclorama behind that.
The proscenium was to be narrowed or widened to suit the
size of production and cyclorama. The house itself was to
be as adjustable, with a ceiling that let down in such a way
as to cut the seating capacity from three or four thousand
to fifteen hundred.</p>

<p>While this project waited on capital, an almost hopeless<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</span>
condition in Austria, and hints began to come that the <em>Festspielhaus</em>
would have to be built in Geneva instead, a new opportunity
came to Reinhardt’s hands through President Vetter,
head of the Austrian State theaters, an opportunity of working
in a playhouse that agreed with much that Reinhardt had
felt about the relations of audience and actor. He was invited
to produce five or six plays in the fall of 1922 in the new
theater in the Redoutensaal in Vienna. Here, upon a stage
practically without setting, and within a room that holds actors
and audience in a matrix of baroque richness, Reinhardt
will have produced, by the time this book appears, the following
plays: <em>Turandot</em>, Gozzi’s Italian comedy, <em>Clavigor</em> and
<em>Stella</em> by Goethe, Molière’s <em>Le Misanthrope</em>, and <em>Dame Cobalt</em>
by Calderon. Here he will have to work in an absolutely non-realistic
vein, he will have to explore to the fullest the possibilities
of the new and curious sort of acting which I have
called presentational. This adventure in Maria Theresa’s ballroom
will measure Reinhardt against the future.</p>

THE ARTIST AS DIRECTOR</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">The</span> director of the future may not be a director of
to-day. He may not be a director at all. He may
be one of those artists whose appearance has been
such a distinctive and interesting phenomenon of the twentieth
century theater. While we examine Max Reinhardt to discover
if he is likely to be the flux which will fuse the expressionist
play and the presentational actor, it may be that the
man we seek is his former designer of settings, Ernst Stern.</p>

<p>The relation of artist and director in the modern theater has
been a curious one, quite as intimate as that of pilot-fish and
shark, and not so dissimilar. Attached to the shark, the pilot-fish
has his way through life made easy and secure; he is
carried comfortably from one hunting ground to another.
Often, however, when the time comes to find food, it is the
pilot-fish that seeks out the provender, and prepares the ground,
as it were, for the attack of the shark. Then they both feast,
and the pilot-fish resumes his subordinate position.</p>

<p>We may shift the figure to pleasanter ground by grace of
Samuel Butler, the Erewhonian. This brilliant, odd old<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</span>
gentleman, a bit of a scientist as well as a literary man, had
a passion for transferring the terms and conceptions of biology
to machinery and to man’s social relationships. Departing
from the crustaceans, which grow new legs or tails as fast
as the old are cut off, he said:</p>

<p>“What ... can be more distinct from a man than his
banker or his solicitor? Yet these are commonly so much
parts of him that he can no more cut them off and grow new
ones than he can grow new legs or arms; neither must he
wound his solicitor; a wound in the solicitor is a very serious
thing. As for his bank,—failure of his bank’s action may be
as fatal to a man as failure of his heart.... We can, indeed,
grow butchers, bakers, and greengrocers, almost <em>ad libitum</em>,
but these are low developments and correspond to skin, hair,
or finger nails.”</p>

<p>I do not know whether it would be right to say that directors
have grown artists with great assiduity in the past twenty
years, or that the greatest of the directors have become as
closely associated with particular artists as a well-to-do Englishman
is with his banker or his solicitor. At any rate the
name of Reinhardt is intimately associated with the name of
Stern; Jessner has his Pirchan, Fehling his Strohbach; I have
spoken of the close relationship of Weichert and Sievert, and
I could point out similar identifications in America. An artist
of a certain type has come into a very definite, creative connection<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</span>
with the art of production, and he has usually brought
his contribution to the theater of a particular director.</p>

<p>The designer is a modern product. He was unknown to
Molière or Shakespeare; the tailor was their only artist. Except
for incidental music, costume is the one field in which
another talent than that of actor or director invaded the
theater from Greek days until the last years of the seventeenth
century. There were designers of scenery in the Renaissance,
but they kept to the court masques. Inigo Jones would have
been as astonished and as shocked as Shakespeare if anybody
had suggested that he try to work upon the stage of the Globe
Theater. The advent of Italian opera—a development easy
to trace from the court masques—and the building of elaborate
theaters to house its scenery, brought the painter upon the
stage. The names of the flamboyant brothers Galli-Bibiena
are the first great names to be met with in the annals of scene
painting. And they were the last great names until Schinkel,
the German architect, began in the early nineteenth century
to seek a way of ridding the stage of the dull devices of the
current scene painters. Scenery was not an invention of Realism;
it was a much older thing. I doubt if any one more
talented than a good carpenter or an interior decorator was
needed to achieve the actuality which the realists demanded.
When artists of distinction, or designers with a flair for the
theater appeared at the stage door, it was because they saw
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</span>Shakespeare or Goethe, von Hofmannsthal or Maeterlinck
sending in their cards to Irving or Reinhardt or Stanislavsky.</p>

<br>

<p>Now what are the relations that this modern phenomenon
has established with the theater through the medium of the
director? Ordinarily they differ very much from the attitude
that existed between the old-fashioned scenic artist and the
director, and the attitude that still exists in the case of most
scenic studios. This is the relation of shopkeeper and buyer.
The director orders so many settings from the studio. Perhaps
he specifies that they are to be arranged in this or that fashion,
though usually, if the director hasn’t the intelligence to employ
a thoroughly creative designer, he hasn’t the interest to care
what the setting is like so long as it has enough doors and windows
to satisfy the dramatist. Occasionally you find a keen,
modern director who, for one reason or another, has to employ
an artist of inferior quality. Then it is the director’s ideas and
conceptions and even his rough sketches and plans that are executed,
not the artist’s. In Stockholm, for example, Harald
André so dominates the official scene painter of the Opera
that the settings for <em>Macbeth</em> are largely André’s in design
though they are Thorolf Jansson’s in execution. Even in the
case of the exceptionally talented artist, Isaac Grünewald, with
whom André associated himself for the production of <em>Samson
and Delilah</em>, the director’s ideas could dominate in certain
scenes. For example, in the beautiful and effective episode of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</span>
the Jews in the desert which André injected into the first
act—a scene for which the director required a symbolic picture
of the fall of the walls of Philistia to accompany the
orchestral music which he used for this interlude. The brilliance
with which Grünewald executed the conception may
be judged from the accompanying illustration.</p>

<p>The commonest relationship of the director and the designer
has been coöperative. The artist has brought a scheme of production
to the director as often, perhaps, as the director has
brought such a scheme to the artist. The director has then
criticized, revised, even amplified the artist’s designs, and has
brought them to realization on the stage. And the artist and
the director, arranging lights at the final rehearsals, have come
to a last coöperation which may be more important to the play
than any that has gone before.</p>
<br>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="no-indent"><em>Samson and Delilah</em>: the mill. A remarkable example
of an essentially ornamental theatrical setting,
designed by Isaac Grünewald for the Royal
Opera in Stockholm. Black emptiness. A slanting
shaft of light strikes the millstone in a vivid
crescent. As the wheel travels in its track this
crescent widens to a disk of blinding light, and
then shrinks again. The actual forms of this
setting are sublimated into an arresting composition
of shifting abstract shapes of light.</p>
</div>
</figcaption>
</figure>
<br>

<p>You find, however, constant evidence of the artist running
ahead of the director in the creation of details of production
which have a large bearing on the action as well as on the
atmosphere of the play. Grünewald brought a setting to the
mill scene in <em>Samson and Delilah</em> which was not only strikingly
original and dramatic, but which forced the direction into
a single course. The usual arrangement is the flat millstone
with a long pole, against which Samson pushes, treading out
a large circle as the stone revolves. The actor is always more
or less visible, and there is no particular impression of a cruel
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</span>machine dominating a human being. Grünewald changed all
this by using a primitive type of vertical millstone. The
sketch shows the stage in darkness except for one shaft of light
striking sideways across. The great wheel is set well down
front within a low circular wall. Along the wall Samson
walks, pushing against a short pole that sticks out from the
center of one face of the high narrow, millstone. As he
pushes, the stone swings about and also revolves. This allows
the beam of light to catch first a thin crescent at the top of
the curving edge of the wheel, then a wider and wider curve,
until suddenly, as Samson comes into view, the light brings
out the flat face of the wheel like a full moon. Against this
the actor is outlined for his <em>aria</em>. Then, while the orchestra
plays, he pushes the wheel once more around. This arrangement
is extraordinarily fine as a living picture and as an expression
of the mood of the scene. Moreover, it is a triumph
for the artist, because it is an idea in direction as well as setting.
It dictates the movement of the player and manages it in the
best possible way. No other action for Samson is possible in
this set, and no other action could be so appropriate and
effective.</p>

<p>Examples of similar dictation by the artist—though none so
striking—come to mind. In Frankfort Sievert arranged the
settings for Strindberg’s <em>Towards Damascus</em> in a way that contributed
dramatic significance to the movement of the players.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</span>
The piece is in seventeen scenes; it proceeds through eight
different settings to reach the ninth, a church, and from the
ninth the hero passes back through the eight in reverse order
until he arrives at the spot where the action began. Sievert
saw an opportunity to use the revolving stage, as well as elements
of design, in a way interpreting and unifying the play.
He placed all nine scenes on the “revolver,” and he made the
acting floor of each successive setting a little higher than the
last. This results in rather narrow rooms and a sea shore
bounded by formal yellow walls, but it permits an obvious
unity, it shows visually the path that the hero has to follow,
and it symbolizes his progress as a steady upward movement
towards the church.</p>

<p>The artist dictating a particular kind of direction is obvious
enough in <em>Chout (Le Bouffon)</em>, the fantastic comic ballet by
Prokofieff which Gontcharova designed for the Ballets Russes.
Gontcharova’s settings are not particularly good, but at least
they have a definite and individual character. They are expressionist
after a fashion related more or less to Cubism. They
present Russian scenes in wildly distorted perspective. Log
houses and wooden fences shatter the backdrop in a war of
serried timbers. A table is painted on a wing, the top tipping
up at an alarming angle, one plate drawn securely upon it,
and another, of <em>papier-mâché</em>, pinned to it. All this sort of
thing enjoined upon the <em>régisseur</em> a kind of direction quite
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</span>as bizarre, mannered, and comic. <em>Chout</em> seems to have had
no direction at all in any creative sense. The <em>régisseur</em> failed
to meet the challenge of the artist.</p>

<br>

<p>It is ordinarily very hard to say what share the artist or the
director has had in the scheme of a setting, or whether the
director has bothered his head at all about the setting after
confiding it to what he considers competent hands. It is an
interesting speculation just how much the physical shape of
Reinhardt’s productions has been the sole creation of his artist,
Stern. Certainly Stern delighted in the problems which the
use of the revolving stage presented, and only in a single mind
could the complexities of these sets, nesting together like some
cut-out puzzle, be organized to a definite end. It is entirely
possible that, except for a conference on the general tone of
the production, and criticisms of the scheme devised by Stern,
Reinhardt may have given no thought at all to the scenery.
Stern was a master in his own line, and for Reinhardt there
was always the thing he delighted most in, the emotional mood
produced by the voices and movements of the actors. His
carelessness of detail even in the acting, suggests that for him
there were only the biggest moments, the important elements
and climaxes, that put over the emotion of the play.</p>

<p>Sometimes artist and director are the same, as with Pitoëff
in Geneva and Paris, or with Knut Ström in Gothenburg. In
such a case setting, direction, and acting are one. But ordinarily<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</span>
there is a division of responsibility, and an opportunity
for the artist to play a part in the production of a drama far
more important than Bibiena’s. Just how important it may
prove to be is bound up, I think, with the future of the theater
as a physical thing, and with the temperament of the artist.
Working as a designer of picture-settings, the artist can only
suggest action, but not dictate it, through the shapes and atmospheres
he creates. The important thing is that almost all the
designers of real distinction in Europe are tending steadily
away from the picture-setting. They are constantly at work
upon plans for breaking down the proscenium-frame type of
production, and for reaching a simple platform stage or podium
upon which the actor shall present himself frankly as an
actor. This means, curiously enough, that the designers of
scenery are trying to eliminate scenery, to abolish their vocation.
And this in turn should indicate that the artist has his eye on
something else besides being an artist.</p>

<p>The director who works in such a new theater as the artists
desire—in the Redoutensaal in Vienna, for example,—requires
an artist to work with him who sees art in terms of the arrangement
of action upon steps, and against properties or screens.
This is ordinarily the business of the director in our picture-frame
theater; with the work of the artist enchantingly visible
in the setting behind the actors, the director can get away reasonably
well with the esthetic problems of the relations of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</span>actors and furniture and of actors and actors. Nobody notes
his shortcomings in this regard. Put him upon an almost naked
stage, and he must not only make his actors far more expressive
in voice and feature, but he must also do fine things
with their bodies and their meager surroundings. This is far
easier for a pictorial artist than for the director, who is usually
an actor without a well-trained eye. The director must therefore
employ an artist even in the sceneryless theater, and employ
him to do what is really a work of direction. The two must
try to fuse their individualities and abilities, and bring out a
composite director-artist, a double man possessing the talents
that appear together in Pitoëff.</p>
<br>

</div>
</figcaption>
</figure>
<br>

<p>The immediate question is obviously this: If the director
cannot acquire the talents of the artist, why cannot the artist
acquire the talents of the director? If the knack of visual
design, and the keen appreciation of physical relationships cannot
be cultivated in a man who does not possess them by birth,
is it likewise impossible for the man who possesses them to
acquire the faculty of understanding and of drawing forth
emotion in the actor?</p>

<p>The problem narrows down to the temperament of the artist
<em>versus</em> the temperament of the director. There is a difference;
it is no use denying it. The director is ordinarily a man sensitive
enough to understand human emotion deeply and to be
able to recognize it, summon it, and guide it in actors. But he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</span>
must also be callous enough to meet the contacts of direction—often
very difficult contacts—and to organize not only the
performance of the players, but also a great deal of bothersome
detail involving men and women who must be managed and
cajoled, commanded, and worn down, and generally treated
as no artist cares to treat others, or to treat himself in the process
of treating others. The director must be an executive,
and this implies a cold ability to dominate other human beings,
which the artist does not ordinarily have. The artist is essentially
a lonely worker. He is not gregarious in his labor.</p>

<p>So far as the future goes, the hope for the artist is that he
will be able to reverse the Butlerian process which held in the
relations of director and designer. He must be able to “grow a
director.” This may not be so very difficult. It may very well
happen that an artist will employ a stage manager, as an astute
director now employs an artist, to do a part of his work for him.
He will explain to the stage manager the general scheme of
production that he wants, much as a director explains to an
artist the sort of settings he desires. The stage manager will
rehearse the movements of the actors towards this end. When
the artist sees opportunities for further development of action
and business, he will explain this to the stage manager, and perhaps
to the players involved, and the stage manager will again
see that the ideas of his superior are carried out. Something
of the kind occurs even now where a director employs a subdirector
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</span>to “break in” the company. Both Reinhardt and
Arthur Hopkins, though thoroughly capable of “wading into”
a group of players, and enforcing action by minute direction
and imitation, generally use the quiet method of consulting
with players, and suggesting changes to them, not during the
actual rehearsal, but afterwards in the protection of a wing
or the privacy of a dressing room.</p>

</figure>
<br>

<p>The presence of the artist as director in some future theater
without scenery, implies a decided influence on the type of
acting.</p>

<p>Such a stage itself, thrust boldly at the spectators, if not
actually placed in the midst of them, tends to dictate a frank,
direct contact between players and audience. In such a house
an actor will be all but forced to desert the purely representational
style of to-day, and to present himself and his emotions
in an open, assertive, masculine manner as objects of art
and of emotion.</p>

<p>The tendency of the artist towards this kind of theater implies,
I think, a tendency towards presentational acting. Certainly
I have talked with few who were not receptive to it.</p>

<p>Put together a stage that tends towards presentational acting
and an artist whose instincts run to the same ends, and the outcome
is not difficult to foresee.</p>

<p>The problem at present is, what artist? And where? And
how soon?</p>

A NEW ADVENTURE IN DIRECTION</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">The</span> outstanding director in the German theater to-day
is also the most radical director. And the most
radical director is at the head of the Prussian State
Theater, the Schauspielhaus, in Berlin. His name is Leopold
Jessner, and he is the only man who has threatened to fill the
place made vacant by Reinhardt’s retirement. Some say that
he has already filled it, and—with disarming logic—that
Reinhardt was only a mountebank anyhow. Some think Jessner
a clever eccentric. Certainly he is the most discussed
personality in the German theater, and his methods are the
most debated.</p>

<p>One word crops up whenever his name is mentioned—<em>Jessnertreppen</em>.
The German language has boiled down into
a single word an idea that we would have to phrase as “those
crazy steps of Leopold Jessner.” It makes a handy stone for
the anti-Jessnerites to throw at the director’s friends. Jessner’s
friends are beginning to have the good sense to pick up the
stone and throw it back. For the word <em>Jessnertreppen</em> hits off
a virtue—perhaps, the main virtue of the man.</p>

<p>Jessner fills his stage with steps. He seems unable to get
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</span>along without them. He must have platforms, levels, walls,
terraces. They are to him what screens, towering shapes,
great curtains are to Gordon Craig. In every production Jessner,
through his artist, Emil Pirchan, provides some permanent
foundation besides the stage-floor for the actor to play upon,
some arrangement of different levels. In his <em>Richard III</em> it is
a wall all across the stage, with a platform along the top at
the base of another wall, and for certain scenes a flight of
steps like a pyramid placed against the lower wall. In <em>Othello</em>
Jessner uses two platforms, one on top of the other, each
reached by two or three steps, the lower a long ellipse almost
as large as the stage, the upper one smaller and proportionately
broader; upon the upper platform Jessner places certain indications
of setting. For Grabbe’s <em>Napoleon</em> he uses four or five
steps rising sharply to a platform perhaps four feet high.
Sometimes this platform is supplemented by a high one pulled
apart in the middle to make opposing hills, redoubts, vantage
points in the battle scenes.</p>

<p>The <em>Jessnertreppen</em> are the key to the physical things in
this director’s productions. They give the stage one general
shape for each play. They establish a formal quality. They
tend to banish representation in scenery, since only indications
of setting harmonize with their frank artificiality. And—their
main purpose—they provide the director with most interesting
opportunities for manœuvering his actors.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</span></p>

<p>One of the simplest and most obvious of these is a new way
of making entrances. Such steps as are used in <em>Othello</em> and
<em>Napoleon</em> go down at the back as far as they rise in the front,
and below that the director opens a trap or two in the floor.
Thus he is able to have an actor walk straight up out of the
back of the stage, and appear in a dominating position in the
middle of the action. Jessner uses this novel means of entrance
again and again in <em>Othello</em>, and it is always fresh and effective.
For the return to Cyprus the Moor marches triumphantly up
these steps, to the welcome of his wife.</p>

<p>Far more important, however, is what Jessner does with
the front of the steps. They may be there to help a formal
stage with very little scenery to seem steadily interesting even
to audiences that expect the conventional gauds of the
theater. But their true office is to make possible a sort of three-dimensional
direction for which Jessner has become renowned.
Ordinarily the actor moves in only two directions upon the
stage—right and left, and towards the footlights and away
from them. As a matter of fact, the latter movement is so
unsatisfactory from the point of view of any spectators except
those in the balconies, that the actor really has only one plane
in which he can move visibly and expressively. Jessner does
more than add a third dimension when he sends his actors up
and down the steps. He also gives a great deal more significance
to the movement towards and away from the audience.</p>

<br>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</span></p>

<p>Beside the sense of movement—always an intriguing thing
in the theater—Jessner provides in his steps a mechanism
for solving many dramatic problems. His actors do not spend
their time getting out of the way of the actors behind them.
They are not shuttling back and forth in an effort to let the
audience see all the players at the same time. One actor cannot
“cover” another if he stands on steps. Even a very large
crowd can appear on such a stage without the individual speakers
being lost. As Lee Simonson showed in his use of different
levels for the Theater Guild’s production of <em>He Who Gets
Slapped</em>, with the proper sort of elevations on the stage a
large number of actors can play a very complicated scene without
confusing their relationships or assuming awkward positions.</p>

<p>But a great deal more important than this negative virtue is
the positive contribution of steps in permitting many more and
much finer compositions than the flat floor permits. Jessner
composes freely in three dimensions. He composes both for
esthetic and for dramatic effect.</p>

<p>There are times when you can see him arranging his actors
with nothing but the esthetic aim in mind. Take the first
scene in which Napoleon himself appears in Grabbe’s drama.
It is not a particularly good setting in some ways; it is a rather
obvious and ugly silhouette of a bastion and a slanting parapet
leading up to it. The scene shows Napoleon receiving reports<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</span>
from an officer and giving orders. Jessner deliberately places
Napoleon on top of the bastion against the sky and stands the
officer stiffly on the parapet below; the relation of the two
men as characters in the play is thus established visually as
well as through the text. The relation of the two men as a
composition—not as characters—has to be disturbed by the
entrance of a second officer. It is obviously impossible for
Napoleon and the first officer both to retain their positions if
the second officer is to fit into a composition. Accordingly the
first moves just enough to establish a new esthetic relation
embracing all three.</p>

<p>Jessner is free with his dramatic compositions and occasionally
altogether too obvious. He keeps his dominant people
at the top of the <em>Jessnertreppen</em>, or brings them down as they
lose command. He handles the accession of Richard III as
Shakespeare did, and as very few directors have since done.
When the burghers come to ask Richard to be king, they find
him “aloft, between two bishops,” in compliance with Buckingham’s
advice: “Go, go up to the leads.” Jessner has Richard
walk upon the platform above the wall; it is his first
appearance on high and he maintains his place until the battle
at the end. At the close of <em>Napoleon</em>, the emperor, who has
appeared hitherto only at the top of the steps, is seen seated,
broken and disconsolate, on the lowest step of all, with a sinking
sun behind him, and the soldiers above.</p>

<br>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</span></p>

<p>It would seem safe to infer from all this that Jessner is
not a realistic producer. He might, of course, have achieved
many of these effects within a natural setting, but only at the
cost of a great deal of laborious planning and manœuvering.
As a matter of fact, Jessner doesn’t use one ounce of energy trying
to be either natural or plausible. His method is openly
expressionistic.</p>

<p>Jessner distorts the natural in a hundred ways to achieve
something expressive of the drama. The first scene in <em>Napoleon</em>,
as he gives it, is supposed according to the text to pass in
the arcades of the Palais Royal, lined with booths. Various
episodes, dialogues, and harangues take place between different
speakers and different knots of the crowd. The usual method
of handling such a scene is to turn on and off the speech of
the different groups of actors at will, making certain speakers
and parts of the crowd obligingly inaudible to the audience.
There is little enough of nature in such a business, but Jessner
banishes even that. He keeps the stage empty except for small
crowds that rush out, along with the speakers or show-barkers,
for particular episodes.</p>

<p>Jessner handles crowds even more arbitrarily at times. Later
in <em>Napoleon</em>, during a riot preceding the news of Napoleon’s
return from exile, a revolutionist kills a tailor. As his body
sinks to the steps, the crowd of red-clothed men and women
falls upon him, almost as if to devour the corpse, and covers the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</span>
steps as with a great blood-red stain. In <em>Richard III</em>, when
Gloucester appears as king in a red cloak upon the top of
the red steps, which are placed for this purpose against the
wall, his eight retainers, also in red, sink down in a heap
below him like a pile of bloody skulls. In <em>Othello</em>, when the
Moor returns in triumph to Cyprus a cheering crowd comes
with him up the steps from the back. When he has reached
the top and can go no higher, the crowd sinks prostrate. For
a moment he seems to grow in stature, and his triumph to
tower upward.</p>
<br>

<br>

<p>These are all compositions in three dimensions, as well as
violations of ordinary human conduct. Jessner can also create
symbolic action out of unnatural action without any particular
aid from the steps. The scene of Napoleon’s entrance into the
throne room of Louis XVIII is an interesting example. The
steps give prominence to the throne, and enable the audience
to see better; but Jessner’s symbolism has nothing to do with
the steps. The scene is made up of some curtains masking
each side, two wings cut in rococo curves and ornamented
with lilies in rococo patterns. A flat backdrop of the same
design and colors—not a very good design or very French colors—completes
the room. In this room in an earlier scene Louis
has held audience, a fat, yellow-and-white egg of a man, like
some Humpty-Dumpty caught in a flood of the fierce white
light that is supposed to beat about a throne, and all too seldom
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</span>does anything of the kind. But now Louis is gone, and the
lilies of the wall are shadowed by curtains of Napoleonic blue,
which have, for some unaccountable reason, got themselves
hung in the room. Napoleon enters through the gap in the
curtains, reaches up, seizes the edge of one of them, and pulls
it down over the glory that was Bourbon. Then he turns and
faces the audience while two files of soldiers march stiffly past
him to the opposite side from which each entered. The gesture
to the curtains, and the <em>staccato</em> march of the soldiers back
of Napoleon, set out the drama of his returning power.</p>

<p>Naturally Shakespeare, even more than Grabbe, gives Jessner
exceptional opportunities to symbolize and formalize in
direction. He is quick to seize them—particularly in the soliloquies.
He begins <em>Richard III</em> with Gloucester speaking to
the audience as Prologue; he ends it with Richmond as Epilogue.
Jessner always flings asides directly at the spectators.
When he comes upon soliloquies—as in Brakenbury’s musings
after Clarence has fallen asleep in his cell—he cuts them off
sharply from the previous action by altering the lighting, and
bringing the actor down-stage to speak full at the audience.
He places the murderers squatting on the prompter’s box for
much of their chatter. He has the scrivener read Hastings’
condemnation to the audience from the same vantage point,
and upon this relic, in poses fashioned a little after Rodin’s
<em>Burghers of Calais</em>, he places the three citizens who discourse<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</span>
of the old king’s death and the sorry state of the realm.</p>

<p>Jessner is quite as arbitrary in his handling of light as in
his handling of people. He does not use light merely to illumine
the stage, as directors did thirty years ago. He does not
use light and shadow merely to define action by making faces
and figures more dynamic, as Appia set modern producers
doing. He uses light and shadow as a parallel expression to the
play. Light and shadow act the drama almost as much as do
the players. The light is not in the least “natural.” It suits
the mood of the scene. It waxes and wanes with the progress
or the action. When the little princes enter in <em>Richard III</em>
the light shines out more brightly. When Othello dies, it
grows dim, then a sharp shaft of light shoots out from the
prompter’s box, and throws the shadow of Iago over the tragedy
he has caused, and the shadow of the great canopied bed
spreads out over the cyclorama, which has stood as a sort of
limit of space about the play. Jessner is particularly fond
of shadows. When one rival meets another and vanquishes
him, Jessner will have him literally “throw him into the
shade.” Spotlights, flashing on, create meaningful shadows.
An amusing example occurs in the soliloquy of Richard ending:</p>

</div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</span></p>

<p>As Richard says this, the lights on the stage go down, and a
spotlight from the prompter’s box throws his humped shadow
on the wall.</p>

<br>

<p>Jessner has his players under unusual control, and he permits
very little of the accidental expression of feeling which
Gordon Craig inveighs against in the actor. He even forbids
the little shiftings and motions of the hands which are natural
to anybody, actor or layman, while listening to a long
speech from another. Jessner’s actors, if they are not speaking,
and if their emotions are not being very markedly played
upon, are held motionless. They do not move a limb. I
have heard that, in a ball room scene, Jessner kept dozens of
players absolutely immobile in the poses of the dance while
the two principals talked.</p>

<p>Jessner’s company, as it appears in <em>Richard III</em>, <em>Napoleon</em>,
and <em>Othello</em>, displays no extraordinary talent. The director
has instilled a vitality as sharp as the silence and immobility
which he frequently demands; and they play with that drive
and that sharpness of accent which are inherently German.
But there is no genius here, no Moissi.</p>

<p>Fritz Kortner, who plays Richard and Othello, is the outstanding
figure, but he seems a player of limited vision and
not very great technical range. He plays both parts on the
same two notes: a soft, precise, and almost whispering voice,
and another that rasps and all but squalls. Both are a little<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</span>
monotonous in tempo and accent. He uses the voice of the
dove a great deal in <em>Othello</em>, both to establish the Moor’s kind
and noble nature, and also as a base upon which to rear the
contrast of his anger. The dove is a serpent in <em>Richard</em>.</p>

<p>Physically, Kortner’s Richard is odd and striking. The
actor is not very tall, and he is decidedly thick in figure. His
attitudes, the apelike swing of his arms, his pudgy face, twisted
by an evil grin, give him an odd appearance that constantly
suggests other images than Richard himself. A humped toad,
a fat, cross monkey, a grinning Japanese mask, the mask of
a Greek comedian—finally the truth strikes home: it is the
<em>Balzac</em> of Rodin.</p>
<br>

</div>
</figcaption>
</figure>
<br>

<p>There is a moment in <em>Richard</em> when this curious figure is
forgotten. It is the dream of the king the night before the
battle of Bosworth Field. (Why is it, by the way, that no
producer seems to have the genius and naïveté to produce this
scene as Shakespeare wrote it, to place the tents of Richard
and of Richmond on either side of the stage, and to let the
ghosts bless Richmond and curse Richard alternately as they
do in the text?) Jessner shears away the blessings, and lets
the ghosts curse in the wings. Upon the slant of the blood-red
steps lies Richard sleeping. As the voices call, he writhes
and twists upon his uneasy couch. The voices rise and race,
his agitation grows more and more horrible, until at the end
his humped body is beating a fearsome tattoo to the rhythm of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</span>the cursing ghostly voices. Immediately after this really effective
and fine scene, comes the extraordinary, much talked of
and quite ludicrous end of Richard. He has his scene with
the generals, then goes off to battle—or is it merely to tear off
his coat of mail and his shirt? At any rate he is on the
stage a few moments later, staggering along the top of the
wall, naked to the waist. He cries: “A horse! a horse!
my kingdom for a horse!” Then he mounts his sword and,
as if on a hobby horse, hops down the steps until exhaustion
overcomes him and he falls.</p>

<p>Perhaps this indicates the fault that at present keeps Jessner
from being a great director. His judgment and his taste—which
mean the soul with which he interprets and animates
his work—are very, very faulty. There is no austerity and
almost no true beauty in his <em>Othello</em>, only strength. There is
no dignity in his <em>Richard III</em>, only horror. He has made
Richard terrible, but only with the terror of wormy graveyards.
There is nothing of 15th century England in it, none
of the beauty and flash of the time to make the hideousness of
Gloucester the darker. The play is drowned in black—dirty,
mean black. Far worse, it is stripped of the qualities that are
Shakespeare. Worst of all, there is no shred of poetry in the
whole length of the production, unless it is the final moment.</p>

<p>If you can forget the question of taste—if you do not care
what interpretation a man puts on a great work of art—you<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</span>
must admit Jessner to a very high place as a director. He has
originality, ingenuity, bravery, an uncommon technical ability.
He is industrious, and indefatigably careful. His sins are not
the sins of Reinhardt. No detail escapes him; so small a thing
as off-stage noise he handles with the greatest skill. But Jessner
is no poet.</p>

<p>With the question of taste goes also another fault, not so
grave, yet important and perhaps significant. Jessner appears
to worship the obvious, to believe that the theater is a place of
A. B. C. impressions and reactions. He is daring enough in
his technique but not in his ideas. He flings out symbols right
and left, but they are the symbols of the primer. He directs in
words of one syllable. <em>Richard III</em> is an explanation in black
and white, which occasionally ventures to lisp in white and
red. Richard begins the play in black against a black curtain,
speaking the soliloquy of “Now is the winter of our discontent.”
Richmond ends it in white against a white curtain
with his speech to Stanley and his soldiers converted into a
soliloquy to the audience. The troops of Richard are red-clothed
figures crossing the red steps. The troops of Richmond
cross it in white. This is symbolism in baby-talk, presentational
production in kindergarten terms. It is not impossible
that an audience is up to more than that.</p>

<p>It may be, of course, that Jessner is feeling his way and that
to-morrow he will venture upon subtlety—if it is in him. At
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</span>any rate, here is a presentational director, a man who forswears
resemblance and the picture frame, and who sets actors and
their movements, the setting and its lights, talking directly to
the audience. This is an advance in the methods of production
which makes the new movement of twenty years ago look like
an afternoon stroll, a revolt which makes that much-hailed
revolution seem a pleasant little excursion. It is an advance
and a revolt, however, still looking for a leader.</p>

<p>The Berlin Volksbühne is interesting enough in itself.
As the only organization that has been able to produce successfully
this expressionist tragedy of communism, its power and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</span>position seem highly significant. This society of proletarian
playgoers was founded more than thirty years ago as a sprouting
bed for naturalistic drama and the social thesis-play. To-day
it still cultivates the best in Realism and in the social drama,
but it looks condescendingly on the thesis-play, and it gives the
most completely artistic and successful example to be seen in
Germany of an expressionist play and an expressionist production.</p>

<p>The Volksbühne has always had a double policy—that
of buying out performances of good plays and retailing the
seats to its members for much less than the box office prices, and
that of producing plays itself. It began with a few Sunday performances
of both kinds, and steadily grew in membership to
the point where it buys all the Sunday matinees at a number
of theaters, has two playhouses of its own, the Volksbühne and
the Neues Volkstheater, and is organizing an opera house, the
Volksoper. One hundred and eighty thousand men and women
of the lower and lower-middle classes subscribed in 1922 for
eight productions, either at the society’s theaters or at the playhouses
with which it deals.</p>

<p>The Volksbühne itself is rather an extraordinary theater.
Its striking front, with the words <em>Die Kunst dem Volke</em> upon
its pediment, rises across a street that cuts through the workingmen’s
quarter of Berlin, and, after a slight bend, crosses the
Spree and becomes Unter den Linden. From above its little<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</span>
triangle of park, the Volksbühne stares ironically and, doubtless,
a little proudly down the long street that passes the hideous
art galleries of the Prussian government, the palaces once occupied
by the Hohenzollerns, the State Opera, where royalty
turned its back upon Richard Strauss, and runs on to the Brandenburger
Tor of Imperial memories. The theater has the
grimly noble air of the best of German architecture. In its
auditorium Oskar Kaufmann has turned from the austerity of
gray stone to the richness of red mahogany. The working class
audiences of the Volksbühne find themselves seated, therefore,
in the handsomest and doubtless the most costly auditorium of
Berlin when they come to see the play which might almost be
the story of their own defeat in the communist risings of 1919.</p>

<p><em>Masse-Mensch</em> itself is a play, half dream and half reality,
in which is pictured the conflict of <em>Masse</em>, the masses, against
<em>Mensch</em>, the individual, of violent revolution against passive
strike. Its drama pleads piteously for the sacredness of human
life and the equal guilt of the State or the revolution that takes
it. Because it was written by Ernst Toller, who, as he wrote it,
lay in a Munich jail serving a twenty-year sentence for his
part as Minister of Justice in the red rebellion which followed
the assassination of Kurt Eisner by the reactionaries, <em>Masse-Mensch</em>
is pretty generally taboo in German theaters. In
the first six months after its <em>première</em> at the Volksbühne
(29th September, 1921) it was played about seventy times, a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</span>very great number of performances in repertory. But upon its
production in Nuremberg riots interrupted the first performance,
and it was never repeated.</p>

<p>To the significance of the play itself and the proletarian
organization which flings it in the face of a Germany where
monarchists and republicans, socialists and communists, State
and cabals, murder with almost equal recklessness, must be
added a truly remarkable type and quality of production. It
bears a certain relation to the work of Jessner at the State
Schauspielhaus, where, by the way, Fehling is now to be employed.
It is absolutely free of Realism and representation—as
all expressionist production must be. It reduces setting to
less than symbol, to what is hardly more than a convenient
platform for the actor. It uses light arbitrarily.</p>

<p><em>Masse-Mensch</em> is a piece in seven scenes. The first, third,
fifth and seventh are actual; the others are dream-pictures.
In the first scene Toller’s stage directions call for “The rear
room of a workingman’s meeting hall. On the white-washed
walls, portraits of leaders of the people and photographs of
union delegates. In the center a heavy table, at which a
woman and two workmen are seated.” The stage directions
for the second scene, or first dream-picture, read: “Indicated:
The hall of a stock exchange. At the desk, a clerk; about him,
bankers and brokers.”</p>

<p>The playwright felt keenly the possibilities of the modern,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</span>
subjective methods of productions, or he would not have used
the word, “indicated.” He did not feel them clearly enough,
however, to risk more than their application to the dream-pictures.
But, taking “Indicated” as a key-word, Fehling has
boldly ventured to apply abstract and expressionist methods to
the whole of this thoroughly expressionist play. In the first
scene, for instance, as you see it at the Volksbühne, there is no
hall, there is no desk, there are no portraits. There is nothing
but a deep box of high black curtains, and in the center a very
low, broad platform. Upon this platform, spotted out with
three shafts of light, are the two men and the woman in the
taut attitudes of wrestlers as they clasp hands, the woman in
the middle. For the dream scene, the stage is again in black
curtains, but those at the rear are occasionally opened to show a
clerk on an impossibly high stool, writing on an impossibly high
desk, almost in silhouette against the yellow-lighted dome. A
few steps lead down into the darkness of the front stage.
Fehling and his stage designer, Hans Strohbach, pursue the
same general method in the succeeding scenes. The “real”
episodes are set in black curtains and with steps of one sort or
another; they are lit by obvious beams of light, and they are
given no more color than shows in the woman’s severe blue dress
and one glimpse of the yellow dome. The dream-pictures are
more elaborately staged, though they seem quite bare by the
standard of our productions. The curious part is that the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</span>scenes of reality are more expressionistic, considering their purpose,
than the dream-pictures. Reality is made of nothing
but abstract plastic shapes, harsh, and harshly lit. Dreamland
is sometimes painted and shaped in the slightly decorative spirit
of Expressionism, and it is lit with beauty and atmosphere.</p>

<br>

<p>The effective arrangement of Strohbach’s scenes, and the
powerful use which Fehling makes of them stamp the physical
side of this production with distinction. Spiritually it is even
more distinguished because of the rightness of vision with
which Fehling interprets the play, and the brilliance with
which he handles, not only the individual acting, but a chorus
of united voices, which speaks through many scenes with an
extraordinary clarity and emotion.</p>

<p>From the beginning of the first scene the actors strike the
note of intensity and conviction, both as players and as characters,
which they are to carry through the whole performance.
Mary Dietrich, once of Reinhardt’s company, plays superbly
the woman protagonist of the strike and of humanity. From
the moment when her husband comes to her in the name of love
to ask her to give up the leadership of the strike, which will
begin next day, Dietrich drives with such furious precision at
the meaning of this woman that she stands out immediately as
a sort of Christ-figure. In the beginning she must give up
all; she must leave home and love, to follow her call. In the
end she must go to the scaffold rejecting all means of escape. It<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</span>
is one of the distinctions of this play, as well as of Dietrich’s
playing, that this reference to Christ is so beautiful and so sure,
yet so reticent.</p>

<p>The second scene, the dream-picture of a stock exchange, is
a foreboding and dread satire. The bankers and brokers bid
up human souls in the war that is under way, and make plans
for an international corporation, which, posing as a founder of
homes for convalescent soldiers, will open brothels for the
troops. The woman appears in her dream, and makes a vain
appeal to the humanity of these men. The bankers hear only
the announcement of a mine accident and plan a benefit dance,
beginning with a fox-trot by the brokers around the stage.</p>

<p>The third scene is the labor meeting at which a decision
is to be taken on action to stop the making of munitions and
end the war. Here again, Fehling throws the author’s realistic
stage directions overboard (much, be it said, to the author’s
pleasure). Instead of a hall, there is again blackness, emptiness.
Out of the emptiness speaks a marvelous choral voice, the
voice of the masses, measured, vibrant, intense:</p>

<p class="no-indent"><em>Masse-Mensch</em>: the revolutionists’ meeting. On
a broad flight of steps rising steeply from the footlights,
men and women are grouped in an irregular
lozenge, arbitrarily lit by sharp beams of light
from the top and sides of the proscenium arch.
A Fehling production designed by Strohbach.</p>
</div>
</figcaption>
</figure>
<br>

<p>Nothing like this voice, coming out of a darkness in which
faces vaguely begin to hover, has been imagined, much less attempted,
in our theater. The lights rise—or it would be more
accurate to say, shoot down—upon the men and women workers
standing in an irregular lozenge shape upon steep steps, which
spread to the curtains at each side. Out of this crowd, in
chorus and singly, come pleas for action, and visions of suffering
which sweep the audience with emotion. The woman cries
for a strike against war and against capital. Behind her rises
The Nameless One, the bastard of War, to cry for armed revolt.
His passion sweeps the masses, and the woman submits.</p>

<p>The fourth scene, another dream-picture, envisages her fears
for the course of the revolution, her intuition that it will only
breed a new violence, the violence of the proletariat. Below
great, crooked, towering walls, guards hang over green lanterns.
They sing ribald songs of their miseries. The Nameless One
enters, and, standing in the middle, plays wildly on a concertina,
while the guards and the condemned dance the dance of death
about him. The sky lights up on a sudden in crimson, then
pulses in and out; colors flood down over the moving figures in
waves that throb with the music. Among the condemned is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</span>
the husband of the woman. She tries to save him, as she would
save all men from violence. Her pleas are useless. She stands
with him before the firing squad as the curtain falls.</p>

<p>The fifth scene, the tremendous scene of the play and the
production, is the rally at the workers’ headquarters in the face
of defeat. The stage is again boxed in black. There are
steps like the corner of a pyramid rising up to the right of the
audience. Upon these steps gather the working people. You
see a host, affrighted and cowering, in the twenty-four men and
women who stagger upon the steps singing <em>The Marseillaise</em>.
As they sway, locked together hand in hand, like men on a
sinking ship, and the old song mounts up against the distant
rattle of machine guns, the scene brings the cold sweat of desperate
excitement to the audience that fills the Volksbühne,
and to comfortable, purse-proud Americans as much as to men
who have fought in the streets of Berlin. Suddenly there is a
louder rattle of arms. The noise sweeps through the air. It
drives into the souls of the huddling men and women. They
collapse, go down, fall in a tangled heap. The curtains at the
left loop up suddenly. There in the gap against the yellow
sky stand the soldiers. They arrest the woman, the woman
whom the rebels were about to condemn for her opposition to
their slaughter.</p>

<br>

<p>The sixth scene is a dream-picture of the woman in prison.
There is a void, a misty, swimming emptiness. Upon a platform
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</span>is the woman’s cell, a scarlet cage in which she can
only kneel. About her stand guards, bankers, the ghosts of
dead enemies. They accuse her. She answers. At last, out
of the void rise the shapes of the masses, the imprisoned masses
who have been betrayed by violence and by the woman who
deserted them and cast her lot with violence. They move in
a great circle of towering shadows that seem to hang in the
emptiness of the sky, as they pass across the dome at the back
of the stage. The guilt of the masses, the guilt of the individual,
the guilt of the woman—they have filled the air with
recrimination. The figures of the imprisoned masses stop suddenly
in their round. They raise their arms. They cry: “We
accuse!”</p>

<p>There is only the final scene left. It is in her cell. Again
the black curtains; some narrow steps. The husband comes
to bring her freedom. The Nameless One also, with a plan of
escape through murdering the guards. She rejects both. She
rejects the priest, accusing men of primeval sin. She goes to
her death. And as she goes, two women prisoners sneak out
into the light—to divide the clothes of this new Christ.</p>

<p><em>Schuldig!</em> Guilty! Guilty! The word echoes through
the play, echoes in the auditorium of the Volksbühne. All are
guilty. All are sick with guilt. And none more than these
sufferers in the slums of Berlin who must go to the theater to see
in black curtains the picture of their guilt. The world goes<span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</span>
through capitalism, debasing itself, driving terror, greed,
cruelty into the place of love and understanding. It comes out
in revolution, a corruption of the thing it cures. The Germans
have been through capitalism with a vengeance, through materialism,
through war, and through a revolution that blasted half
the people and did not satisfy the rest. Here is the misery of
capitalism, the misery of abortive revolution, the misery of
defeat and black hunger. Berlin is in purgatory. And Berlin
goes to <em>Masse-Mensch</em>. Before this play sit hundreds of quite
ordinary men, who have only to hear some word shouted at them
with the passion of this play, and they will leave the slow and
loved routine of homes, and lie again behind sandbags on Unter
den Linden. All this is a strange, terrible, and sweet thing
to feel as you sit looking at the purgatory of those black curtains.</p>

<p>Toller and Fehling have made possible the realization of
this intense situation between play and audience; Toller by
writing straight at the heart of his public. His dialogue makes
no pretense to the accidental rhythms of life. It speaks out
plainly and simply and beautifully the passion of each character,
the passions of the world. Fehling has driven Toller’s
speeches just as directly at the public. He has made no pretense
at actuality. He has put his actors forward as actors on
an abstract stage; and you think of them only as living, intimate
presences.</p>
<br>

</figure>
<br>

<p>Comparison between Fehling and Jessner is inevitable.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</span>They are both working upon the newest problem of production,
the problem of escaping from Realism to reality and to the
theater. They both throw overboard every shred of actuality
that stands in the way of inner emotional truth. Technically,
Fehling is as insistent as Jessner on the abstract, the formal
production as the means of giving the actor and his emotion
vividly and completely to the audience. Fehling realizes as
keenly as Jessner does how different playing-levels can help
him in deploying and emphasizing his actors. He does not,
like Jessner, use the same levels throughout a play. He creates
new plastics as he needs them. His production is formal in
principle, but he does not rely upon a stage of certain permanent
forms. His lighting is abstract, like Jessner’s, paying no attention
at all to actuality; but it is not so free or so wilful in
changes. The lights make a definite pattern in each scene and
stick to it throughout. The only sharp exception is the scene
of the dance of the condemned. Fehling does not try to make
his lighting a running gloss to the words of the play.</p>

<p>Fehling may be much over-praised by the emotion of <em>Masse-Mensch</em>;
perhaps there is a something in the passion of the play
which lights up these players and these playgoers of the
Volksbühne, and brings forth a unique and unwilled emotion.
But there seem to be certain qualities in this production which
stamp the director as a man of imagination and power.
Certainly Fehling has a large and healthful simpleness. He<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</span>
isn’t finicking over rudimentary explanations with lights and
shadows and primary colors. He isn’t missing the quality of
the play in an endeavor to create a thing of a single startling
or novel tone. He is certainly winning from his actors a spiritual
coöperation finer than any that we saw in Germany. He
is unmistakably one of the leaders along new paths—a sure and
challenging force.</p>

“THE THEATER OF THE FIVE THOUSAND”</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">Over</span> some fifteen years a growing number of minds
have been more or less actively seeking a way towards
a new type of theater. They have been abusing the
picture-frame stage, stamping on the footlights, pulling out the
front of the apron, pushing the actors into the loges, down the
orchestra pit, onto the prompter’s box, out upon runways or up
the aisles. They have even gone clear out of the playhouse and
into circuses, open air theaters, and public parks. All to set up
a new and mutual relationship between the actor and the audience.</p>

<p>You might almost say to set up any mutual relationship at
all; for the players of the peep-hole theater of Realism, the
picture-frame theater, the fourth wall theater, can hardly be
said to have anything resembling a relationship to the spectator.
The thing peeped at can’t be aware of the peeper. A
picture does not know that it has an audience. Walls may
have ears, but the fourth wall has no eyes. It is the essence of
Realism and of realistic acting that they have their justification
in the thing they resemble, not in the people who may or may<span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</span>
not be able to recognize the resemblance. A perfect realistic
performance is a thing so close to life that it cannot permit itself
to be aware of even its own existence. Its perfection is so much
more related to the thing it imitates than to the audience which
looks at it, that it would be no less perfect if there were no one
at all to look. The fourth wall <em>is</em> a fourth wall. It might
just as well be as real as the other three. Alexander Bakshy
wrote of Stanislavsky’s company: “It would have made scarcely
an atom of difference to the adequacy and completeness of the
Art Theater’s performance if the audience had been entirely
removed.”</p>

<p>Such performances can be very interesting in their way,
extraordinarily interesting, in fact, when such players as
Stanislavsky’s bring spiritual distinction to their Realism. But
there is another sort of thing that can be interesting, too.
Some think it can be more interesting; at any rate they want to
find out what it was that kept the theater contented for the
twenty-five centuries before it knew Realism. They want to
draw out the actor and the spectator; the actor out of the picture
frame and the spectator—if the actor is good enough—out
of his seat. They want to make the actor an actor once more.
And they think that a new sort of theater—or a very old sort—might
have something to do with it.</p>

<p>Directors have thought about it, and playwrights, dancing
teachers, architects, scenic artists, actors, and critics. Max<span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</span>
Reinhardt put a runway over the audience in <em>Sumurûn</em> more
than a dozen years ago and staged Sophocles in a circus. Percy
MacKaye developed the community masque as a new form of
outdoor theatrical performance through <em>The Masque of St.
Louis</em> and <em>Caliban</em>, and brought it indoors with <em>The Evergreen
Tree</em> and <em>The Will of Song</em>. Jaques-Dalcroze, deviser of the
eurythmic system of dance-education, created in Hellerau-bei-Dresden,
before the war, a hall holding the stage and the spectators
within translucent walls lit by ten thousand lights, and
there, with the aid of Adolphe Appia, he gave Paul Claudel’s
drama <em>L’Annonce faite à Marie</em>. Frank Lloyd Wright, designing
a theater for Aline Barnsdall of Los Angeles, created
a model showing an adjustable proscenium, which was hardly
a proscenium, a domed stage which curved into the lines of the
auditorium, and a permanent architectural setting consisting of
a wall twelve feet high running across the stage. Herman
Rosse, the scenic artist, took to sketching theaters with all manner
of odd forestages and portals. Norman-Bel Geddes threw
off in 1914 a plan for a theater with stage and audience housed
under a single dome, and in 1921 designed a magnificent project
for the production of Dante’s <em>The Divine Comedy</em> in Madison
Square Garden in a permanent setting of ringed steps, towering
plinths, and light. Gémier, the French actor, introduced the
Reinhardt circus-theater to Paris. Jacques Copeau left his
reviewing of plays to create in the Vieux-Colombier a theater<span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</span>
without a proscenium, and with a forestage and a permanent
setting, in order to give his troupe of actors a fresh and truly
theatrical relation to their audience.</p>

<p>The first attempts to escape from the realistic theater were
Gargantuan. It seems as if there were something so essentially
small about our theater that a huge thing was the natural alternative.
Max Reinhardt and Percy MacKaye, the two men who
began the break with the realistic theater, and who carried their
conceptions furthest, plunged immediately to the huge, the
magnificent. They could have found inspiration in Gordon
Craig, as practically every innovator in our playhouse has done.
For Gordon Craig, too, saw a gigantic vision of the break between
this peepshow of ours and the next theater:</p>

<p>“I see a great building to seat many thousands of people.
At one end rises a platform of heroic size on which figures of a
heroic mold shall move. The scene shall be such as the
world shows us, not as our own particular little street shows us.
The movements of these scenes shall be noble and great: all
shall be illuminated by a light such as the spheres give us, not
such as the footlights give us, but such as we dream of.”</p>

<p>MacKaye had a family tradition to urge him towards large
experiments. His father, Steele MacKaye, irritated no doubt
by the limitations of the nineteenth century theater as we are
irritated by the limitations of the theater of the twentieth
century, conceived and all but launched a grandiose and extraordinary<span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</span>
scheme for a playhouse at the Chicago World’s Fair.
The Spectatorium, which was to seat ten thousand people and
give a spectacle of music and drama, movement and light,
dancing and action, on land and on water, was burned, however,
before it could be completed.</p>

<p>The dominating idea in the younger MacKaye was to create
a dramatic form of and for the people. It was to celebrate the
works of humanity; <em>The Masque of St. Louis</em> commemorated
the founding of the western city, and <em>Caliban</em> the tercentenary
of Shakespeare’s death. The MacKaye masque was to be
acted and danced by the community with the assistance of a
few trained players, and it was to be seen by as many as possible;
in St. Louis 7,000 took part and 200,000 looked on. The
experience of these community masques led MacKaye to want
the active participation of the citizens as audience as well as
of the citizens as actors, and in <em>The Evergreen Tree</em> he
arranged a Christmas festival, to be given either out of doors
or within, in which the spectators sang with the chorus and
the actors, who passed through the midst of them. Another
desire of MacKaye’s was the enlarging of the characters of
his masques to gigantic size. He did this literally in <em>The
Masque of St. Louis</em> with the huge figure which stood for
Cahokia. In <em>The Will of Song</em>, given its first production indoors,
he began to work upon the idea of the “group being,”
a single dramatic entity visualized through a mass of players.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</span></p>

<p>Whether or not Reinhardt began his first great circus-production,
Sophocles’ <em>Œdipus Rex</em>, with an esthetic philosophy,
he had one before he was finished with <em>Orestes</em>, Hauptmann’s
<em>Festspiel</em>, and <em>Everyman</em>, the productions which followed.
This was visible in his works as well as in the outgivings
of his <em>Blätter des Deutschen Theaters</em>.</p>

<p>Like MacKaye, Reinhardt found a tremendous fascination
in the relationship of this sort of production to man in the mass.
In the “theater of the five thousand,” as he called it, audiences
are no longer audiences. They are the people. “Their
emotions are simple and primitive, but great and powerful, as
becomes the eternal human race.” This follows from the
nature of the theater and the relation of the actors to the audience.
Monumentality is the key note of such great spaces.
It is only the strongest and deepest feelings—the eternal
elements—that can move these great gatherings. The small
and the petty disappear.</p>

<p>Yet the emotion is direct and poignant, according to Reinhardt,
because of a spiritual intimacy established by the new
relation of actors and audience. In the Circus Schumann in
Berlin Reinhardt revived the Greek orchestra. At one end of
the building was the front of a temple. The actors came out
in great mobs before the temple, upon an acting floor surrounded
on three sides by banks of spectators. In the theory and the
practice of Reinhardt there should be no curtain to conceal the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</span>
setting. When the spectator enters he finds himself in the
midst of great spaces, confronted by the whole scene, and himself
a part of it. When he is seated and the play begins he
finds that “the chorus rises and moves in the midst of the audience;
the characters meet each other amid the spectators; from
all sides the hearer is being impressed, so that gradually he becomes
part of the whole, and is rapidly absorbed in the action,
a member of the chorus, so to speak.” This is a point that
Reinhardt has always stressed in his big productions. This
desire to make the spectators feel themselves participants is the
same desire that MacKaye has carried to the point of actually
making them so.</p>

<p>Reinhardt stressed the importance of the actors being made
one with the audience through appearing in their midst. This
maintained the intimacy which, he felt, was the most valuable
contribution of the realistic movement in the theater—an
intimacy produced in the main by the small auditoriums
required if conversational acting were to be audible. Gigantic
conceptions and tremendous emotional emphasis could thus be
brought home to the spectator.</p>

<p>Technically the circus-theater made interesting demands.
From the <em>régisseur</em> and the scene designer it required the utmost
simplicity. Only the biggest and severest forms could be
used. Light was the main source of decoration; it emphasized
the important and hid the unessential. Acting, too, underwent<span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</span>
the same test. The player had to develop a simple and
tremendous power. He had to dominate by intensity and by
dignity, by the vital and the great. There had to be music in
him, as there had to be music in the action itself.</p>

<p>The war prevented Reinhardt from continuing his experiments
in mass-production, and bringing them to fruition in a
theater built especially for the purpose. With the coming
of peace he was able to remodel and re-open the old Circus
Schumann as the Grosses Schauspielhaus. But in less than two
years Reinhardt had left it in discouragement, his great
dream shattered. By the summer of 1922 it could definitely
be stamped an artistic failure—crowded to the doors every
night.</p>

<p>It is not easy to trace the cause of failure, but it seems to lie
in the curious fact that here Reinhardt was both careless and
too careful. Physically the theater was wrong, if the theory
was right, and its physical mistakes can be traced to Reinhardt.
He was too careful in planning it and not courageous enough.
Because he feared for its future as a financial undertaking, he
seems to have compromised it in form, in order that it could be
used as an ordinary, though huge playhouse if it failed as a
new kind of theater. He put in the Greek orchestra surrounded
on three sides by spectators. He made the floor
flexible in its levels, and led it up by adjustable platforms to
a stage at one side of the house. This much was right enough.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</span>But then he made the thing a compromise between the Greek
theater, a circus, and the modern playhouse, by slapping a
proscenium arch into the side wall and installing behind it a
huge stage with all the mechanical folderols of the day—great
dome, cloud-machine, revolving stage. It was beyond human
nature to resist the temptation of playing with the whole
gigantic toy. Neither Reinhardt nor the directors who succeeded
him could be content, as they should have been, to lower
the curtain across the proscenium, to plaster up the fourth wall.
Perhaps there were not enough great dramas like <em>Œdipus</em> to
draw for months the gigantic audiences needed to support the
venture; but this only meant that such a theater must be maintained
for festival performances, not that it must be filled with
bastard productions requiring a picture stage and largely inaudible
across the spaces of the Grosses Schauspielhaus.</p>

<p>Reinhardt was as careless in his selection of an architect as
he was careful in compromise. His original conception of the
place was excellent. He wanted it primitive and grand. He
wanted it to soar. And he thought of early Gothic. Between
the pillars that had to be there to support the roof of the old
circus, he wanted a dark blue background, a background of
emptiness. The dome over the middle was to vanish into a
deep presence, lit sometimes by dim stars. Some one got to
Reinhardt, and persuaded him that he must be “modern;” he
must assume a leadership in architecture; he must give a chance<span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</span>
to the greatest of the new architects, Hans Poelzig. Reinhardt
consented. And Poelzig produced a very strange affair.</p>

<p>Some of the mistakes of the Grosses Schauspielhaus may be
laid to the old building. The banks of seats are rather close
against the roof, while the middle of the house is bridged by a
gigantic dome. These conditions might have been minimized
by giving the low portion lines that seemed to mount, and perhaps
by closing in a large part of the dome or darkening it.
Instead Poelzig has made the dome the only lovely and aspiring
part of the architecture. It is a dream of soaring circles.
If the building could only be turned upside down, and the
actors could play in this flashing bowl, while the audience
looked down upon them—!</p>

<p>The whole house, its innumerable corridors, its foyers and
promenades, the walls of the auditorium, the ceiling, the
capitals of the columns that support the dome, the dome itself—every
inch of the whole is dominated by a single decorative
<em>motif</em>, a very shoddy, cheap <em>motif</em>. This is a pendant,
stalactite arch, borrowed from the Moorish architecture of
Spain, and reduced to the lowest terms of mechanical rudeness.
The theater is of concrete and stucco, and this dull shape is
repeated endlessly and tediously, as if it had been scalloped out
by a machine. Only in the dome, or when it is no more than
hinted at in certain wall surfaces, does this shape do anything
but bore and depress. On top of this, Poelzig had stained the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</span>
walls of many corridors and rooms in a yawping red, and
turned the main foyer into a ghastly sea-green cavern. The
theater is nervous, horrific, clangorous, glowering. There is
nothing fountain-like. No spirit wells up in beauty. There
is no dignity and no glory.</p>

<p>The fault may not be Poelzig’s, but the lighting of the stage
and orchestra seems unfortunately handled. Some of the
lights for the inner stage are placed in front of the arch of the
proscenium instead of behind it, and thus they illuminate it,
and emphasize something that ought not to be there at all, let
alone pointed out. The lights for the orchestra originally came
wholly from the lower edge of the dome. It was necessary,
however, to supply more, and they have been placed in an ugly
red hood, which sticks out from the proscenium with no relation
to the rest of the house. The lights in the dome stab with
a glorious brilliance; the great beams seem to descend unendingly
before they reach the tiny figures of the actors, and spot
them out of the darkness. But these lights make the first
mistake of trying to hide themselves, and the second mistake
of not succeeding in doing so. How much better it would be
if they were treated frankly as part of the theater; if their
source were admitted; if these lamps were hung in great
formal chandeliers made a part of the decorative design of the
production. For Romain Rolland’s <em>Danton</em> the astute Ernst
Stern hung huge lanterns over the scene of the revolutionary<span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</span>
tribunal; it was a method that should have been perpetuated.</p>

<p>The productions that Reinhardt made are no longer to be
seen in the Grosses Schauspielhaus, for repertory vanished from
his theaters along with Reinhardt. You hear, however, of
many interesting and beautiful things in <em>Danton</em>, in <em>Œdipus</em>,
in <em>Hamlet</em>, in <em>Julius Cæsar</em>, in Hauptmann’s <em>Florian Geyer</em>.
But you see no such things now, or at least we did not see them
when we were in Berlin. We saw the orchestra filled with
seats—perhaps to swell the meager seating capacity of three
thousand which was all Poelzig could include after he had
wasted front space on rows of boxes and wide-spaced chairs, and
perhaps because the new directors feared to use that glorious
and terrible playing floor. We saw the forestage shrunk to a
platform jutting out perhaps twenty feet. We saw a tedious
performance of <em>Die Versunkene Glocke</em>, with the action shoved
into the realistic proscenium, with the scenic artist fooling
about with sloppily expressionist forms, and with the mountain
spirit hopping down the hillside with a resounding wooden
thump. We saw Hebbel’s <em>Judith</em> done with much more effectiveness,
though without real daring or vision.</p>

<br>

<p><em>Judith</em>, however, shows some of the possibilities of such a
theater. The beginning strikes in on the imagination with
the impact of the shaft of light that beats down on Holofernes,
sitting like some idol on his throne. Though he is almost back
to the curtain line, instead of out in the midst of the people, he
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</span>drives home the effect of seeing life in the round which such a
theater can give. Here is talking sculpture. The costumer,
as well as the actor, is given a new problem: the problem of
clothes and the body that, like a statue, must mean something
from every angle, must have beauty and significance from the
back as much as from the front. The costume of Holofernes,
at least, achieved this. The actor has another problem, the
problem of a different movement and a different speech, movement
slower and grander, or else long and swift, speech that
is more sonorous, more elaborately spaced. The actor’s part—in
spite of rather second-rate players—is the part best done at
the Grosses Schauspielhaus. There is a natural aptitude in
the German player for the grand, slow speech, the roaring
tempest. It is like the aptitude of the German people for the
grand slow play. They like drive, rather than speed. They
want to hear dull sonorous platitudes driven out by sheer belly-muscle.</p>

<p>There is one thing very beautiful in <em>Judith</em> and in this
theater. It is the way a player can come forward to the edge
of the forestage, and stand there alone, stabbed at by a great
white light, surrounded first by emptiness, and beyond that
by crowds, a brave figure alone in a great dim space. That is
something you cannot feel in the chummy confines of a picture-frame.</p>

<p>The Grosses Schauspielhaus is a gigantic failure if you look<span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</span>
at it with vision—and also a great portent. The place is ugly,
and its purpose now debased, yet it hints at how beautiful a
great, formal theater could be, how moving and inspiring its
drama. Even in the wreckage, the idea still lives.</p>

<p>And if you try to bring a little of that same vision to the
spectacle of the man who made this failure, and who ran away,
you cannot deny an admiration for the courage to give up, to
admit defeat, and then to go to the church, and to try to do
there, in the sanctified birthplace of the modern theater, something
to lift the spirit as high as the theater of the five thousand
was to have lifted it.</p>

THE THEATER OF THE THREE HUNDRED</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">Size</span> is no mania with the French. They do not insist
on buildings that are taller than those of any other
nation, an empire that is larger, ambitions and dreams
mightier and more terrible. So perhaps it was only natural
that when a Frenchman wanted to present actors in a new
relationship to their audience, he should choose for his theater
a little hall in the Street of the Old Dovecot instead of a circus
or a park.</p>

<p>Doubtless there were many reasons why Jacques Copeau’s
theater had to be small. A potent one may have been economy,
a thing that accounts for the little theater movement far more
than any theories of intimacy. The question of repertory also
may have had weight. There are many sizes of drama, and
there are special repertories for special theaters; but many more
plays are possible for a theater of five hundred seats than for a
theater of five thousand. <em>The Trojan Women</em> can be played
to one hundred and twenty-nine people in the Toy Theater of
Boston, as Maurice Browne proved; but <em>Le Misanthrope</em> is impossible
in the Yale Bowl.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</span></p>

<p>Copeau’s theater had to be small, not only because he had
little money and a great love of all sorts of plays, but also because—and
this counted more than even the French liking for
the moderate and the exact—the thing he was interested in was
the actor and not a grandiose idea. He ended by creating the
first presentational playhouse in the modern world, by maintaining
for a long time the most radical, and by achieving after
some years the most successful. But he began by looking for
some place for his actors to act. They were to be a company
of fresh, sensitive, intelligent spirits bringing an intense and
honest art to those who might care for it. Copeau had found
his actors in all manner of places besides the routine theaters.
He had talked to them about everything but make-up, curtain
calls, and how to be natural on the stage. He had played with
them and worked with them in the country, rehearsing the first
pieces of the repertory in a barn. He did not intend to dump
them down into one of the ordinary theaters of Paris. Copeau
proposed to take the hall that his resources permitted, and to
make it over to suit the spirit of his company. He could build
no ideal theater, but he could make one in which his actors
would escape the realisms and the pretenses of the modern
theater, and would play to and with the audience as their spirit
demanded.</p>

<p>And so we have the Théâter du Vieux-Colombier. It is not
at all like the hideous theater-hall that was there before. It is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</span>
not quite as it was when Copeau closed his first season before the
war. It is not in the least like the Garrick Theater, which
he remade in New York in 1917; as a matter of fact it is
not so good. It is not very charming in its shape or its
decorations, and Copeau is as careless as Reinhardt about things
like good painting and clean walls. But this Vieux-Colombier
is a distinguished and a jolly place all the same, the happiest and
the healthiest theater west of Vienna.</p>

<p>It is hard to know where to begin a description of this curious
playhouse. Suppose you had never been to the Vieux-Colombier,
but suppose you knew that this was a theater without the
illusion of Realism, and suppose you sought for the thing that
would tell you this the quickest. What would you see?
Probably the steps that lead from the stage to the forestage,
and even from the forestage to the seats of the audience.
There are no footlights, and so you have the pleasure of seeing
the square, firm edge where the stage floor ends. This edge
bends into a large curve in the middle, with three curved steps
below, and it angles out at the sides to where smaller steps join
those of the middle on an ample forestage. These steps and
the edge of the stage do more than any one thing in the theater
to signal that you are not looking into a picture-frame. Even
when they are not used, as in <em>Les Frères Karamazov</em>, these steps
keep you warily alive to that fact.</p>

<p>When you examine the theater more closely you discover that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</span>
there is no proscenium. The nearest thing to it is the last of the
arches which hold up the roof of the auditorium. There is a
curtain, to be sure, but it does not fall behind pillars, and it does
not cover the forestage. It descends at that point where the
walls of the auditorium become the walls of the stage, and it
merely serves to hide one end of this long room while the stage
hands make small changes in the permanent setting.</p>

<p>The permanent setting, like the theater itself, is an experimental
product of the attempt to provide what the actors need.
It is really no more than a balcony placed against the back wall,
with an arched opening in the middle, and with walls at the
sides that let the actors, who have gone out through the arch,
get off stage unseen. This balcony is so solidly built that it cannot
be taken out, but certain portions are alterable. The
changes in setting are managed by changing the width of the
arch or the line of the top of the balcony, by adding doors, steps
at one side, or railings, and particularly by placing significant
properties or screens upon the stage. Louis Jouvet, stage director
as well as Copeau’s best actor, has done many ingenious
things to make his settings varied enough and characteristic
enough without losing the permanent thing that is common to
them all, and that aids in banishing realistic illusion. A detail
that shows the working of his mind is to be found in the
screens that he uses to create a room in <em>Les Frères Karamazov</em>;
by giving them two or three inches of thickness and a certain
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</span>amount of molding, he has escaped the impression of the bare,
the unsubstantial, and the untheatrical which the screens of
other designers produce.</p>

the mood of the scene without reference to details
of “atmosphere.”</p>
</div>

<br>

<p>The balcony is a most useful feature. It was not accident
that put a balcony in the Elizabethan theater or made the
Greeks use the theologium. It serves a practical purpose, of
course, in any scheme of permanent setting, for it makes it unnecessary
to build balconies for scenes that especially call for
them. A good deal more important to the director is the movement
up and down, as well as sideways and back and forth,
which it gives him. With the forestage, the main stage, and
the balcony, Copeau has almost as useful a base for composing
action in three dimensions as Jessner has in the steps
which he uses in various productions in Berlin.</p>

<p>Sheldon Cheney has called Copeau’s stage a “naked stage.”
It is a happy accident of language that, when you call it a concrete
stage, you describe the material of which it is made and
the feeling of sharp, definite statement which resides in everything
done upon it. The wall at the right of the audience is
solid, the wall at the back, too; the ceiling of the stage has some
openings between steel girders, but it is more like the floor than
the “flies” of the average theater. Only in the left wall of the
stage are there any openings. Through these the actors manage
to exit into the next building. The floor of the stage, except
at the edges, is even more adamant. It will not yield to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</span>
pleas for atmosphere, illusion or any of the gewgaws of our theater.
It is solid concrete. Copeau wanted to give the actor’s
feet a sense of support which they cannot get from yielding and
resounding wood. At the sides is a small section in timber
which permits the use of a stairway to a lower room as in <em>The
S. S. Tenacity</em> or <em>Les Frères Karamazov</em>. In the forestage
are two other openings, covered by wooden and concrete
slabs.</p>

<p>Jouvet’s lighting system is ingenious and philosophically
sound, if not altogether perfect. Practically all the light
comes from four large lamps hung in the auditorium. They
replace footlights, borderlights, and floods from the sides.
Illumination from the auditorium itself is essential to good
stage lighting; the footlights are an unhappy makeshift.
David Belasco very wisely uses a battery of lamps hidden in
the face of the first balcony. In German theaters, the huge
6000-candlepower bulbs developed since the war, tempt directors
to inefficient and distracting lighting from the ventilator
above the main chandelier in the roof of the auditorium.
Neither the latter method nor Belasco’s is wholly satisfactory
in a theater that forswears representation, a theater like the
Grosses Schauspielhaus or the Vieux-Colombier or the Redoutensaal
in Vienna. Electric light on the stage begins as an
imitation of the real. If a table is illuminated by a large light
in the first border, there must be a lamp above the table in such<span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</span>
a position as to suggest that it is doing all the work. The
next step is to use light for illumination and composition—for
beauty, in fact—without bothering to try to make it seem
to come from some natural source in the setting. When such
light comes from the auditorium we may get composition, but
we also get a throw-back to the source of the light itself. The
ray carries our eye up to some lens-lamp trying unsuccessfully
to hide in the bottom of the dome of the Grosses Schauspielhaus,
or in the top of the ceiling of the Burgtheater. A new
problem arises. It should be answered by making the source
frankly visible. The hoods themselves of large bulbs have a
shape that would make them interesting and not without significance
in the Grosses Schauspielhaus; or a new shape could
be supplied to harmonize with architecture or setting. In the
Redoutensaal we find glorious old crystal chandeliers lighting
the stage—an accidental result of the fact that the Viennese
government converted Maria Theresa’s ballroom into a playhouse.
In the Vieux-Colombier Jouvet makes no bones about
admitting where his light is coming from. He places the
bulbs in octagonal lanterns, which, by revolving on an axis,
present different colored sides for the light to pass through;
the lanterns may also be moved in such directions as to throw
the light upon any desired part of the stage. These lanterns
are frankly visible; and, though they are not a pleasing shape,
they fit esthetically with the theory of this theater. Here is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</span>
electric lighting presented at last as the thing it really is, not
as an imitation of something else.</p>

<p>The greatest faults of the Vieux-Colombier over which
Copeau had control, and which he could easily have avoided,
lie in the color and quality of painting on the stage. The concrete
and the cream of the auditorium take warm lights; but in
portions of the stage itself, Copeau has used a cold gray that
is surely unfortunate. Much that you see is shoddy. If the
paint chips off a corner, nobody bothers to replace it. Rivet
heads and structural iron show when they have no relation
to the shapes on the stage. Now it is a good thing not to
spend too much energy on the physical side of the theater, but
there is a difference between austerity and slovenliness.</p>

<p>Actual productions, animated by the actors and graced with
some of Jouvet’s scenic arrangements, do a great deal to make
the stage wholly attractive. <em>The S. S. Tenacity</em>, a realistic
play with a French café for its setting, makes interesting demands
on this non-realistic stage. The demands are met, and
met successfully. There is a counter at one side with racks
for bottles, a wooden door in the arch at the back, a table in
the center, and above it—the mark of Realism—a shaded
lamp, from which a great deal of the stage light comes. With
the actors giving us the sense of French life which was missing
in the New York and Viennese productions, we have here
a performance which might almost be enclosed in a proscenium<span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</span>
frame. But there is in the acting, as in the setting, much that
is non-realistic, much that seems representational only by contrast
with the dominating spirit and physique of the theater
and its people.</p>

<p>In the playlet that goes with <em>The S. S. Tenacity</em>, Mérimée’s
<em>Le Carrosse du St.-Sacrement</em>, we are back in a piece from the
romantic period, a comedy of clear and artificial vigor. A
screen and some hangings with a southern flash to them set
the stage for eighteenth-century Peru. Copeau himself has
the same Punch-like visage that he presents to you in his
own study, but now he manages to make you think him a Spanish
puppet, an exasperated and wily doll. The same Punch
appears in <em>Les Frères Karamazov</em>, but a Punch of the intellect,
a tragic marionette dangling on the strings of rationalism. At
the end, when Ivan goes mad, you may see most clearly the
subtle exaggeration which is at the heart of the acting of
Copeau’s company. The whirling body, the legs that beat a
crazy tattoo on the floor, the twisting head and the boggling
eyes, are none of them copied from a candidate for the asylum.
They are all an explanation of what sort of lines in the figure
of a crazy man would strike the imagination, what angles and
movements would most sharply indicate lunacy.</p>

<p><em>Karamazov</em> is effectively composed on this stage by a few
draperies for the first scene, a line of curtains hiding the whole
stage and begging the question in the second scene, a flight of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</span>
steps for the hall of the Karamazovs, and two heavy screens
for the inn. There is nothing so fine as the interminable steps
that lead up from the balcony at the Garrick to the wretched
room of Smerdiakov; but there is enough improvement in the
very excellent acting seen in New York, to make up for this.
Jouvet’s father is gigantically good; set beside his Aguecheek,
it puts this young man among the most interesting actors of
Europe. Paul Œttly, as the eldest brother, plays the striking
scene in the inn of the gypsies with uncommon vigor, and the
stage direction sweeps the scene along to a burning climax.
The intensity of the actors in this play, added to the intensity
of the play itself, demonstrates how completely a formal theater
of this kind, and a type of acting which is a reasoned sort
of explanation, rather than a thing of life or of acting, can
stand up beside the Realism of our directors when it is at
its best.</p>

<p>In <em>Twelfth Night</em> you find the company clear out of the
shackles of realistic or semi-realistic plays, and happy in the
beautiful playhouse of fantasy. And here the quality of exposition—which
you may trace back to Copeau’s profession of
critic, and forward through the days given to the reading and
study and analysis of each new play—has almost altogether disappeared.
The playing is spontaneous, or it is nothing.
Suzanne Bing’s Viola is a-quiver with radiance and wonder.
Jean Le Goff’s Orsino is no such God-favored performance, but
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</span>his eyes are lit with an ecstasy of love-sickness. The comedians
are far from Englishmen; but their creations are immensely
funny: Jouvet’s gently gawking Aguecheek, Romain
Bouquet’s shaven-headed, almost Oriental Sir Toby, Robert
Allard’s extraordinary clown, the finest either of us had ever
seen. It is interesting, for once, to see Malvolio put in his place
as a character, and not given the star’s spotlight to preen in;
it might be a more satisfactory arrangement if Albert Savry
could be funnier in his dry Puritanism.</p>

<p><em>Twelfth Night</em> triumphs at the Vieux-Colombier by virtue
of the spirit of the actors, and the vision of the director. The
costuming is bad—an unsuccessful attempt to make Illyria, as it
might well be, a land of no time or place but Poetry; and the
setting is no more than bright and freakish in a Greenwich
Village way. But in the costumes and up and down the setting
these players frisk, weaving patterns of beauty and fun that link
them into the true spirit of the play. The curtain is there at
convenient times to make the forestage into a neutral zone for
duke or sea captain, and between this forestage and the balconied
space behind there is room for all of Shakespeare’s play
to race along just as he wrote it. With the trap door in the
forestage to act as cellar, Malvolio can be incarcerated below-stairs
and happily out of sight—much as Shakespeare intended.</p>

<p>Copeau is a believer in gymnastics. (He is also a believer
in improvisation, a school of playwrights, and other things<span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</span>
whose absence makes him grow impatient with his theater).
Through months and years of strenuous labor, he is training
half a dozen young people of his own school to have bodies that
are as well under control as a gymnast’s. The performances of
the Vieux-Colombier draw on players not so well trained, but
they show what physical command can accomplish. Here you
see acting that makes you think again of sculpture and its relation
to the new theater.</p>

<p>Copeau’s people can meet the test which the theater with a
Greek orchestra, like the Grosses Schauspielhaus, exacts.
They can play “in the round.” Their bodies can be seen from
all sides, and still keep expressiveness and beauty. They
have learned to master their bodies, as well as their voices, and
they are able to make the lines of arms and torsos and knees
speak directly to the audience. When Jouvet sharply underlines
and almost caricatures the salient shape of old Karamazov
he is able to escape from ordinary representation, which may or
may not make its point, and he is able to push his conception
of the wicked, vital old man into almost direct physical contact
with the audience. I have often wondered when the actor
would learn the lesson of sculpture. There were centuries of
almost literal representation, with the inner expression of the
artist and the artist’s sense of Form struggling furiously to impose
itself upon Reality, and failing more often than succeeding.
Then, with Rodin came the sense that sculpture could<span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</span>
make representation a distinctly secondary matter. There
could be expression first, and resemblance afterwards, if at
all. Idea, which is one sort of Form, enters the clay with
Stanislas Szukalsky. Expression and idea, poised in the human
body, begin to inform acting directly and openly in the company
of the Vieux-Colombier. The first presentational theater
adds the medium of the body to the medium of the voice.</p>

THE REDOUTENSAAL—A PLAYHOUSE OF
PERMANENCE</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">In</span> Vienna on Christmas Day, 1921, there were no matches
in the match-stands of the cafés and no paper in the hotel
writing rooms. Some of the well-to-do and the recklessly
soft-hearted had begun to feel that they could afford to
keep pet dogs again; but there were no silk stockings on those
most un-Teuton ankles that paraded the Burgring. You may
guess, therefore, that there was no butter on the tables of the
middle classes, and no milk in the houses of those who, by a
curious clairvoyance of language, are called the working people.</p>

<p>Two nights later three or four hundred citizens, with bits of
bread and meat wrapped in paper and stowed in their pockets,
could be seen seated in a great and splendid ballroom of Maria
Theresa’s palace, under the light of crystal chandeliers and the
glow of priceless Gobelins, watching the first performance, <em>The
Marriage of Figaro</em>, in a theater a stride ahead of any in
Europe.</p>

<p>They had paid good money at one of the doors of that extraordinary
old building, the Hofburg, which rambles from the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</span>
Opera to the Burgtheater half across the shopping district of
Vienna. After they had parted from two or three thousand
crowns apiece, they had wound up stone stairways between
white walls and twists of old ironwork, passed through cloakrooms
where princesses once left their wraps, and a supper room
where artists may cheerfully go mad over molding, pediment
and mirror, and reached at last the Theater in dem Redoutensaal.
They found one of the handsomest baroque rooms in Europe
holding within its beauty both a stage and an auditorium.
A row of Gobelin tapestries filled the lower reaches of the walls.
Above were moldings and pilasters, cornices and pargeting,
spandrels and pediments, fillets and panelling, an ordered richness
of ornament that held suspended in its gray and golden
haze mirrors that echoed beauty, and chandeliers radiant with
light. At one end of the room, beneath great doors and a balcony
which the architect had planned in 1744, was a new structure;
it broke the line of the Gobelins, but continued the panelling,
freshened to cream and gold, in a curving wall across a
platform and in double stairs leading to the balcony. With
man’s unfailing instinct for the essence of life, the audience
promptly identified this roofless shell as a stage. There was a
platform, of course, but there was no proscenium. There were
doors and windows in the curving wall, but no woodwings,
borders, flats, or backdrops. There was even a something along
the front of the platform which might conceal footlights, but<span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</span>
there was nothing to be seen that looked more like scenery than
a row of screens.</p>

<p>Such is the room in which the forces of the Austrian State
Opera House have been giving <em>The Marriage of Figaro</em> and
<em>The Barber of Seville</em>, and in which Reinhardt began late
in 1922 the most interesting experiment of his most
experimental life—the presentation of plays under a unique
condition of theatrical intimacy between actor and audience.</p>

<p>It is an odd spectacle, this of Vienna, the bankrupt, going
lightheartedly out on the most advanced experiment in production
yet attempted in Europe. One of its oddest angles is that
the man who made an empress’s ballroom over into a theater
is a socialist—President Vetter of the Staatstheaterverwaltung,
the bureau under the republic which controls the State playhouses.
The conversion was not an easy matter. Opponents
rose up inside the State theaters and outside them. Vienna was
engaged for months upon one of those artistic quarrels from
which it is always drawing new health and spirit.</p>

<p class="no-indent">The Redoutensaal in Vienna as arranged for the
first scene of <em>The Marriage of Figaro</em>. The
room called for in the text is indicated by a row
of crimson screens set straight across the stage and
pierced in the center by a door. In the scheme of
production indicated by this unique environment
such a mere indication is sufficient to establish
setting and mood.</p>
</div>
</figcaption>
</figure>
<br>

<p>When President Vetter had won his point he plunged briskly
ahead at the work of making over the ballroom into a very
special kind of theater without marring its beauty. Part of
the old balcony came out, mirrors replaced doors and windows
down the sides of the hall, and Oberbaurat Sebastien Heinrich
set to work on the problem of creating a permanent architectural
setting for the stage which should harmonize with the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</span>lovely room, yet stand out from it significantly enough to center
attention on the acting space. Meantime President Vetter took
another look at the Gobelins which had satisfied Maria Theresa,
and decided that they weren’t quite good enough; others had to
be found. Even now he is a little doubtful about those on the
right hand wall.</p>

<p>The work of the Oberbaurat is admirable. He has continued
the molding above the Gobelins, and made it the top
of the curving wall which is the background for the stage.
This shell is broken at each side by a casement, which holds
either a door or a window, and two masked openings. Through
one of these, close to the front of the stage, a curtain the height
of the wall is run out to hide changes in the screens and furniture
upon the stage. At the back, where the shell curves close
to the old balcony of the ballroom, the State architect has
placed a pair of graceful steps, which meet at the top, and
provide, underneath, an exit to the rear. For lighting, there
are the foots in their unobtrusive trough, and small floods placed
in the gap where the curtain moves; but by far the larger part
of the illumination comes from the seven chandeliers in the
ceiling of the hall. The chandeliers towards the rear are sometimes
turned half down or even off, but essentially it is the same
light which illumines both players and audience.</p>

<p>This light and the formal and permanent character of the
stage stamp the Redoutensaal with a character as old as it is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</span>
fresh. This theater goes beyond Copeau’s Vieux-Colombier in
the attempt to re-establish in our century that active relationship
between actor and spectator which existed in the great
theaters of other centuries, and towards which the finest minds
of the theater have been striving. Here is a stage freed from
all the associations of modern stage-setting, innocent of machinery
or illusions, essentially theatrical. Actors must be
actors upon its boards. They cannot try to represent actual
people; they can only present themselves to the audience as
artists who will give them a vision of reality.</p>

<p>This is comparatively easy in opera. There is no realistic
illusion about a valet who sings a soliloquy on his master’s more
intimate habits. People who quarrel in verse to a merry tune
are most unlikely to be mistaken for the neighbors next door.
With music and the stage of the Redoutensaal to aid them, the
singers of the State Opera manage to give a roughly presentational
performance. In direction there is nothing notable to
be seen, unless it is the wedding scene of <em>Figaro</em> with the Count
striding up and down across the front of the stage, opposed in
figure and in action to the plaguing women above upon the
stairs. The acting possibilities of this stage, however, are very
great. Reinhardt saw them vividly in the summer of 1922,
while he was making preparations for his five productions in
September: <em>Turandot</em> by Gozzi, <em>Stella</em> and <em>Clavigor</em> by Goethe,
<em>Le Misanthrope</em> by Molière, and <em>Dame Cobalt</em> by Calderon.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</span>
He saw the possibilities and the difficulties of acting also, and
he rejoiced that he was to have old and tried associates like
Moissi, Pallenberg and Krauss with him once more when he
began his experiment with a theater far more exacting than the
Grosses Schauspielhaus, and a technique of acting very hard to
regain after so many years of Realism.</p>

<p>So far as there must be indications of time and place upon
this stage, a beginning in experiment has been made. It has
not been a particularly good beginning, but it shows the opportunities
for the artist, and also the limitations. They are
very nearly identical. It is the business of the scene designer
who works here to draw from the Redoutensaal itself the
<em>motifs</em> and colors which he shall add to the permanent setting.
It is his privilege, using only these things, to give the scene just
the fillip of interest which the play demands.</p>

<p>Alfred Roller, a veteran of the scenic revolt of fifteen years
ago, and, next to Reinhardt’s artist, Ernst Stern, the most distinguished
German scenic designer of his time, has made the
screens and set pieces for <em>The Marriage of Figaro</em> and <em>The
Barber of Seville</em>. There is little or no good to be said of his
work in the latter piece. The screens with which he indicates
a room in the first act, and the bulky gate which he sets down
across the stairs in the second act, are bad as to color, and quite
at odds with the Redoutensaal. Obviously he could have made
so much more amusing a gate out of the permanent stairs, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</span>
given his scene a Spanish stamp by a circle of vivid, tight-packed
flowers in the center. <em>The Marriage of Figaro</em> is much
better, though here again Roller could have done far better
if he had turned his eyes up to the walls above him. The
first scene, the servant’s room, is made by a row of antique
screens of faded crimson placed well down stage. Through a
door in the central one, you see green screens, which, in the second
scene are to define the room of the wife. With an excellent
sense of climax, Roller proceeds from the shallow stage
of the first scene to the deeper stage of the second, and finally
sweeps in the whole permanent setting for the wedding in the
third scene. More than that, he calls the stairs and balcony
into play, and finally opens the great doors above the balcony
to let us see beyond to a room of crimson hangings and more
crystal. The last scene, the garden, is shoddily conceived,
with a few uninteresting potted trees, a bad painting of Schönbrunn
in the exit under the steps, and a sickly attempt at moonlight
from the floodlights and foots. Why not, you wonder,
delicate, artificial, gilded hedges along the walls, and fruit
trees flattened on <em>espaliers</em> against the steps?</p>

<p>Unquestionably the lighting problem in the Redoutensaal is
not yet solved. Reinhardt looks to solve it with a large light
or two concealed in the forward chandeliers. This may make
the illumination of the stage a little more flexible and expressive;
but it is quite as likely that the way to light the stage is
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</span>without the least pretense at illusion. At any rate footlights
and lights from the side are distressing reminders of the conventional
theater.</p>
<br>

while harmonizing with the decorations of

</div>
</figcaption>
</figure>
<br>

<p>Almost as reminiscent is the curtain which slides out between
acts while the stage hands move the screens. Why a curtain at
all—unless the curtain of darkness? Why not uniformed attendants
managing the simple matter of screens or small set
pieces with the aplomb of actors? Or if there must be a curtain,
why a crimson sheet; why not a hanging whose folds continue
the <em>motif</em> of the Gobelins at each side?</p>

<p>Perhaps the most serious question concerned with the physical
arrangements of this stage is whether there should not be
some scheme of levels other than floor and balcony. A lower
forestage would aid the director in composing his people, and
getting movement and variety out of this fixed and therefore
limited setting. It would also aid an audience that is seated almost
on a flat floor.</p>

<p>The sceptic may find other limitations in the Redoutensaal.
And he will be right if he points out that its atmosphere is too
sharply artificial in its distinction to permit every sort of play
to be given here. Gorky’s <em>Night Lodging</em> might be played in
the Redoutensaal as a literally tremendous <em>tour de force</em>, but it
would be in the face of spiritual war between the background
of the stage and the physical horrors of the slums which the
play describes. Plays for the Redoutensaal must have some<span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</span>
quality of distinction about them, a great, clear emotion free
from the bonds of physical detail, a fantasy or a poetry as shining
as crystal, some artificiality of mood, or else an agreement
in period with the baroque. You can imagine Racine or
Corneille done perfectly here, Euripides only by great genius,
<em>The Weavers</em> not at all. Nothing could suit Molière better,
or Beaumarchais or the Restoration dramatists. Shakespeare
could contribute <em>Twelfth Night</em> and <em>A Midsummer Night’s
Dream</em>, perhaps <em>Romeo and Juliet</em>, but never <em>Hamlet</em>. Here,
of course, is a perfect stage for Oscar Wilde, a good stage for
Somerset Maugham, A. A. Milne, some of Clare Kummer.
The Moscow Art Theater would have no trouble with <em>The
Cherry Orchard</em>. More or less at random, you think of Bahr’s
<em>Josephine</em>, <em>The School for Scandal</em>, <em>The Sabine Women</em>,
<em>Lysistrata</em>, <em>The Mollusc</em>, <em>A Marriage of Convenience</em>, <em>The
Truth</em>, <em>Prunella</em>, <em>The Beggar’s Opera</em>. The one impossible
barrier to performance in the Redoutensaal is Atmosphere.
If a play is drenched in the emotions of firesides, poppy fields,
moonlit gardens or natural physical things, it is impossible here.</p>

<p>These are the limitations of the Redoutensaal, not of its idea.
The permanent setting and its enclosing hall can take the shapes
of other periods and meet almost every demand of the drama
except atmosphere. Ideally the hall should have some sober
yet arresting architecture common to many periods. A neutral
order of this sort might be the blank Roman arches and plain<span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</span>
pilasters which are seen so often in modern buildings. The
chandeliers might take a form less ornate and less blazing;
nuances of lighting, if desirable, might then be achieved. More
important, however, would be to have three interchangeable
shells and steps. One set of walls should be classical and severe,
suited to Greek tragedy, <em>Julius Cæsar</em>, and, with a bit of brightening,
to Shaw’s <em>Cæsar and Cleopatra</em>. Another shell should
strike the note of artificial distinction with which the Redoutensaal
now echoes. The third should be of dark, paneled
wood, to suit Shakespearean tragedy, the comedy of Goldsmith,
and modern pieces from <em>Rosmersholm</em> to <em>Getting Married</em> and
from <em>Alice Sit-by-the-Fire</em> to <em>Magda</em>.</p>

<p>The idea of a permanent room in which to act a related repertory
is thoroughly applicable even to our peepshow playhouses
with their prosceniums. It would be possible to install
a shell or room on the stage of any reasonably presentable theater,
such as Henry Miller’s, the Little, the Booth, the Plymouth,
the Selwyn in New York, the Künstler in Munich, the
Volksbühne, the Kammerspiele in Berlin, the Comédie des
Champs-Elysées in Paris, St. Martin’s in London. The room
would have to be formal, probably without a ceiling, and certainly
far more like a wall than a room. Such a compromise
seems the only chance America may have of experimenting
with the idea of the Redoutensaal. There is nowhere in this
country a room so naturally fitted to the purpose by its beauty<span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</span>
as was the ballroom of the Hapsburgs. The building of a
fresh structure is a little too much to ask; for we have hardly
the directors or actors to launch unpractised upon such a costly
and critical test. It might be risked perhaps, as Frank Lloyd
Wright proposed risking it, in a theater of a purely artistic
nature far from Broadway. Wright designed for Aline Barnsdall
a playhouse to be erected in California, with an adjustable
proscenium, a stage with a dome that all but continued over the
auditorium, and, upon the stage, a plain curving wall some ten
feet high, following the shape of the dome. The nearest analogy
to the Redoutensaal that has been actually attempted in
America is probably the adaptation which Director Sam Hume
and the artists Rudolph Schaeffer and Norman Edwards made
of the Greek Theater in Berkeley, California, for <em>Romeo and
Juliet</em> and <em>Twelfth Night</em>. There is a certain significance, however,
in the pleasure which our scenic artists seem to get out of a
play which gives them only one setting to design, but which requires
them to wring from it, by means of lights, many moods
and a variety of visual impressions. Lee Simonson’s circus
greenroom for <em>He Who Gets Slapped</em> and Norman-Bel Geddes’
sitting room for <em>The Truth About Blayds</em> showed how seductive
to the artist of the theater may be the game of playing
with lights in a permanent setting.</p>

<p>Approached purely from the point of view of scenic art, or
the so-called new stagecraft, the Redoutensaal presents excellent<span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</span>
reasons for its existence. Historically it could be defended
by a study of the theater from the Greeks, with their day-lit,
architectural background, to Georgian times when the stage
and the house were both lighted by the same chandeliers, and
the wide apron, the boxes, and the proscenium made a sort of
permanent setting which was varied by the shifting backcloths.
But if we go no further back than the days when Craig and
Appia were beginning to write, and before their voices and
their pencils had won an audience among theater directors, we
shall find the start of an evolutionary development for which
the idea of the Redoutensaal provides a plausible climax. In
the first decade of the twentieth century, the “flat” was flat indeed,
and the painted wing and backdrop ruled. If there was
any depth, it was the space between wing and wing, or the false
space of painted perspective. Then the ideas of Craig and
Appia, making a curious alliance with Realism, forced the plastic
upon the stage. The solid, three-dimensional setting
dominated. When directors and artists began to discover the
physical and spiritual limitations of “real” settings which could
present nothing bigger than the actual stage space, many went
back to the painted flat. It was a different flat, however, one
painted with dynamic and expressive design. The third
method is seldom quite satisfactory. The living actor, with
his three-dimensional being, clashes with the two-dimensional
painting. The result is bad from a realistic or illusionistic<span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</span>
point of view; and, as soon as we think of the stage in terms of
a frank convention, we find that we want the emphasis thrown
upon the actor as the more interesting and the more difficult
element. We want a defined and permanent artificiality that
shall give the actor scope, serve as a <em>pied-à-terre</em>, not join in a
fantastic competition. We can escape plastic and limited reality
in the Redoutensaal, while we supply the actor with a background
that harmonizes with the living character of his body.
At the same time we can secure the vivid indication of mood or
time or place which we seek, and achieve it more vividly because
of the permanence of the main fabric of the stage, and its
contrast with the merely indicated setting.</p>

<p>German scene designers and directors move in theory steadily
towards what they call the podium, the platform pure and
simple, from which the player addresses the audience openly
as a player. In practice they tend steadily to try to approach
this by driving out as much of changing scenic background as
possible. They place something in the middle of the stage, a
table, a flight of steps, a pillar, a bed, and they try to eliminate
the rest of the stage. Jessner does this in Berlin by using his
cyclorama as a neutral boundary without character in itself.
Fehling, the director of <em>Masse-Mensch</em>, uses black curtains,
and the artist Krehan by the same means tries to center our attention
on small set pieces placed in the middle of the stage and
designed to represent corners of rooms or a sofa by a window.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</span>
Black curtains appear everywhere in Germany—perhaps as an
expression of the mood of the beaten nation, but also unquestionably
from a desire to drive out both Realism and pretense
and to leave as little as possible upon the stage except the actor
and the barest and most essential indication of setting. The
German uses black curtains to achieve nothingness. Instead
he gets desolation, spiritual negation. In the Redoutensaal,
the actor is backed up by space. It is a positive presence instead
of a negative background. Yet it does not obtrude, this splendid
room, with its gold and gray, its mirrors and its tapestries.
These things float in the back of consciousness, filling what
might be a disquieting void or a depressing darkness. Always
the cream walls dominate the gray, and always the living actor,
driving his message directly at the spectator, dominates them
all.</p>

THE CIRQUE MEDRANO</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">Perhaps</span> the gladiators gave it a bad name. At any
rate for twenty centuries men have hesitated to put anything
more serious than a clown or an athlete in the
middle of an audience. The Romans could hardly be called a
timorous, a sensitive or a conventional people, yet even they
never thought of presenting a play in an amphitheater. C.
Curio, rich and reckless, celebrated the death of his father by
building two great wooden theaters back to back, giving performances
in both at the same time, then whirling the spectators
about on turn tables, until they faced each other, and the
two semicircles of seats joined and made one huge arena. But,
though Curio was reckless of money and of the lives of his
guests, he was careful of the esthetic proprieties. The actors
performed in the theaters, and the animals in the arena.</p>

<p>So far as the feelings of the Drama can be learned, she did
not approve of the way the Romans shoved her actors out
of the old Greek orchestra, and crammed them into a shallow
little box, which they called a stage. The first chance that the
Drama had, she climbed down close to the people again, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</span>
played on the stone floor of the medieval churches. Even
Shakespeare did not have the temerity to try to put her back in
a box. It is said that there were rare times, as in some of the
outdoor mysteries of the Middle Ages and while the pageant
wagons carried the actors and their scenes into the squares of
the English towns, when you might have found the Drama entirely
surrounded by the hosts of her admirers. But some curious
and perverse power seems to have schemed through the centuries
to seize a decadent time like the Roman days or the last
fifty years in modern Europe, and clap the Drama in a box.
And to-day, when the Drama is bravely insisting on a little air
and light, the power is still strong enough to keep the Drama’s
liberators from placing her naked and unashamed in the center
of her fellows. She is no longer a peepshow lure, but we still
hesitate to treat her as a goddess.</p>

<p>Occasionally a theorist, who is as sick as the rest of us of the
fourth wall convention, comes forward with some extraordinary
proposal to put the audience in the middle of the drama. Furttenbach
in the seventeenth century laid out a square theater
with a stage in each corner. Oskar Strnad of Vienna wants to
place a doughnut stage two thirds round the audience; and some
Frenchman has advocated whirling the doughnut. Anything
to distract the spectator from the drama; nothing to concentrate
him upon it.</p>

<p>In the “Theater of the Five Thousand” devised by Max<span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</span>
Reinhardt in Berlin, and in the imitation which Firmin Gémier
launched at the Cirque d’Hiver in Paris, the audience and the
drama at last met in the circus. But for some curious reason—at
which I have only guessed in a more or less absurd fashion—neither
Reinhardt nor Gémier was courageous or far-seeing
enough to use the circus as a circus. Neither dared put the
players in the center, and forget the old stage. At one side
there always lingered a palace or a proscenium.</p>

<p>Reinhardt might make the excuse that for such a scheme he
needed a round circus, and that a round circus would be far too
big for the drama. (He would not be absurd enough to say
that Moissi or Pallenberg could not act unless all the audience
saw all his face all the time). There are round circuses in
Europe, however, and small, round circuses, and if Reinhardt
could not find one in Berlin, he could have built one for half the
money he put into reconstructing the Circus Schumann into the
Grosses Schauspielhaus.</p>

<p>Up on Montmartre, just under the last heights on which
perches Sacré Cœur, there is such a circus. An intimate circus,
a little circus, just the place to begin the last experiment with
the theater. Copeau could go straight there from the Vieux-Colombier,
and throw his <em>Scapin</em> into the ring without a second’s
hesitation. It would bowl over Paris and half the theatrical
world.</p>

<p>Copeau could go straight there, but I think the audience<span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</span>
should be required, for a time, to make a detour via the top of
Montmartre. Certainly that is the only way to approach the
Cirque Medrano to-day. A <em>fiacre</em> to the funicular. The
funicular to the base of the cathedral. A stroll all round that
boarded-up curiosity. A look-off at Paris swimming in the
ebb-tide of the summer sun. Then supper in the Place du
Tertre. Not for the food, which is as good as any <em>cuisine
bourgeoise</em>; nor for the trees and window-groups out of Manet;
nor for the tubby widow of forty-five who sings:</p>

<p class="no-indent">or the ancient with the two brass buttons in the back of his surtout
and the patience of an English politician, who recites inaudible
and probably unintelligible poetry before passing the
hat. Supper in the Place du Tertre is an appropriate prelude
to the Cirque Medrano because of the dog that watches all evening
from the tin roof of an impossibly ruined house, and the
women straight out of the French Revolution, the days of ’48
and the Commune, who stand about with their great naked
arms akimbo, and their strong sharp chins, high cheek bones,
and eagle eyes waiting for the liberty cap to crown them. The
dog and the women, they are the audience and the show. They
are the Cirque Medrano.</p>

<p>This circus is a golden bowl. At the bottom, no sawdust but a
carpet of hemp, a great “welcome” doormat without the lettering;
we take the deed for the word. Outside the ring is a
parapet nicely carpeted in yellow; one of the clowns finds it
amusing to roll round this track on his shoulders. Above the
parapet rise steep rows of seats, half of them in bright orange
for the spectators with fifty or sixty cents to spend. Higher up
the thin and graceful pillars which support the roof cut across
the vision a little; here there are only benches and the <em>dévotés</em>.
At opposite sides of the ring, walled passages lead out to the
greenroom and public entrances which circle underneath the
seats. Exits for the audience pierce the rows at the four quarters.
From the disk of the dome above, sixteen great lamps
blaze down on the ring, and sometimes a spotlight or two
punctuate the darkness.</p>

<p>If you like to take your pleasure sentimentally, a performance
at the Cirque Medrano is like opening old letters—with
a comic valentine now and then for tonic. Huck Finn
saw a one-ring circus; but Gentry’s Dog and Pony Show is the
farthest that the present generation ever get from the three-ring-and-two-stage
monstrosity which deafens our ears and
dulls our eyes.</p>

<p>The Cirque Medrano is the proper place for artists and <em>connoisseurs</em>.
The fifteen hundred people that it holds can study—and
do study—with the minute intensity of an anatomical<span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</span>
clinic, M. Grossi and Coquette, as the horseman, quite as proud
as his mare, puts her through five minutes of marching to music.
They turn their eyes with just as much appreciation to watch
the aerialists, plunging into their dangerous pastimes under the
lights. Here M. Lionel, <em>Roi du Vertige</em>, gets the sort of attention
he could never win on the vaudeville stage; it must seem to
him sometimes, as he manœuvers gingerly on a chair balanced
by its right hind leg in the neck of a bottle which is perched in
turn on a ten foot pole, that the towering rows of seats are about
to topple over on the strange career which he has made of himself.</p>

<p>There is no question, then, about the sight-lines of the theater
which Copeau should make out of the Cirque Medrano.
There never was such an auditorium for sheer visibility. The
last rows are better than the first; they take in the whole audience
as well as the show, while all you can say for the front
seats is that they would show you half of the laughing or
crying crowd of men and women, hanging over the actors in
far from mute adoration. The slant of these seats is greater
than the slant in Max Littmann’s theaters in Munich, but, because
the rows swing all round, you never get that feeling of
awful vacancy and gap which comes to spectators in the upper
rows of the Prinzregenten and the Künstler Theaters in
Munich. And there is no proscenium arch to press down upon
the poor midgets at the bottom of the playhouse.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</span></p>

<p>“But their backs? How about the actors’ backs?”</p>

<p>That is a foolish question from any one who has ever seen
Copeau’s players, who has watched Jouvet’s back play the
coarse, immense Karamazov, or seen his legs and buttocks
send Aguecheek shuffling across the stage, or caught the whole
quick poise of Suzanne Bing’s Viola in her shoulders and
hips.</p>

<p>It is nothing short of the ravings of a mad man if the questioner
has been to the Cirque Medrano, and looked upon the
clowns. People have wondered how the actors of the Grosses
Schauspielhaus could play to three audiences at once, the one
in front, the one at the right, and the one at the left; here are
the clowns playing to four. It is not all slapstick either.
There is almost no whacking in the clowns’ own turns. In
these scenes they work out broad little comedy skits such as
Ray and Johnny Dooley, Leon Errol and Walter Catlett, Eddie
Cantor and George Le Maire, Willie and Eugene Howard, or
Weber &amp; Fields might offer in our revues. The difference at
the Medrano is that the actors seem to have consciously developed
their gestures and their poses as supplementary expression
to their faces. Also they warily work round during their
scenes, and give each part of the audience the benefit of both
back and face. The comedy of the Medrano is far funnier
than the comedy of <em>The Follies</em> or the comedy of the Redoutensaal
in Vienna; and not because the turns are broader. It is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</span>
funnier because it is so intimately alive, because it is made with
all the actor’s body, and because it is always directed at an audience.
Four audiences at once! It is a priceless advantage.
The actor has always some one to press his art upon. In our
theater half an actor’s body is dead, or else vainly talking to the
scenery. That is an understatement, if anything. The only
way the actor can get directly at our audience, register upon it
the impact of his art, his personality, his emotion, is to turn
away from the scene and make his speech into a monologue.
That is the chief difficulty which stands in way of the sort of
acting which deals directly and frankly with the audience,
which admits that it is art and not reality, which says that the
actor is an actor and the audience is an actor, too; the kind of
acting, in short, which is called presentational in contrast to the
realistic method of representation which rules our theater.
On any stage that is surrounded by its audience, the player can
speak to his fellow-actor and to his audience at the same time.
In the Medrano it is no question of backs or faces. The whole
man plays, and every inch of him has an audience.</p>

<p>There remains, however, the question of setting. Clowns
need no atmosphere, but Hamlet must speak to a ghost. An
acrobat is his own scenery, but Juliet needs a balcony. Can the
Medrano manage such things? Can this open ring do what
the stage of the Redoutensaal balks at?</p>

<p>The Medrano can do almost anything that our theater can do—and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</span>
a great many things more—because it can use the three
essentials of setting and atmosphere: light, human bodies, and
indications of place.</p>

<p>Light.... It is the fifth turn in the Cirque Medrano.
Lydia <em>et</em> Henry, “Babies Dancers,” two pitiable little children,
who have been taught to do very bad imitations of their elders
in the banal dances of the revues. After they have hopped and
shaken their way uncertainly through two or three fox trots
and shimmies, the great lights in the roof go out. Blackness,
then a stain of amber in the center of the ring. The light
brightens and the stain lengthens. It might fall upon the stone
of an old cistern, if some one had thought to put it there.
Then, when the figure of Salome crawls out along the stain,
it would be many moments before we could see that it was the
body of a four-year-old, whom some one had togged out with
breast-plates. Or again darkness, and slowly a blue-green
light from on high, and in the midst of it an Apache and a girl.
It needs no curb, no lamp-post, no brick corner, to make the ring
a moonlit street.</p>

<p>After light, there comes the human body. The Medrano
as a circus does nothing to show how the actors themselves can
make a setting. Why should it? But I remember the project
of an American artist, in 1914, to put <em>The Cenci</em> upon the stage
of a prize ring, and I remember how the sketches showed a
chorus of human figures in costumes and with staves, circling
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</span>about the people of Shelley’s play and forming a dozen frames
to the drama within.</p>
<br>

  <figcaption class="caption"><p class="center no-indent fs80">An impression of the Cirque Medrano in Paris.</p></figcaption>
</figure>
<br>

<p>After light and a setting of bodies comes just as much of
the ordinary plastic scenery of the stage as you need, and just
as little as you can get along with. If you care to dig a bit
under the ring, and install machinery that will lower the floor
in sections, pile up hills in concentric circles or even lift a throne
or a well or an altar into the middle of the circus while the
lights are out—well, there is nothing to prevent you. Juliet’s
balcony may hang above one of the entrances; or in the center
of the stage throughout the whole action of <em>Les Fourberies de
Scapin</em> may stand the <em>tréteau</em> or block, which Copeau makes
the center of the action at the Vieux-Colombier. Scenically
the problem of the Medrano is the most fascinating problem of
the stage artist, the creation of a single permanent structure,
large or small, which can stand throughout a play and give
significant aid to the various scenes.</p>

<p>It is no such difficult task to imagine productions in the
Medrano as it is to find plays for the Redoutensaal. The accompanying
sketch shows an arrangement for <em>The Merchant
of Venice</em>. Glowing Venetian lanterns are hung in the spaces
between the arches at the top of the theater. The four entrances
for the public are made entrances for the players as
well. Below each gate is a double stair, railed at the top with
Venetian iron. Between the stairs are benches, again in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</span>
shape of the period. The railings become the copings of the
Rialto. The casket scenes are played in the center of the arena,
while Portia and Nerissa watch the proceedings from a bench at
one side; another bench seats the judges in the courtroom.
Jessica leans out from an entrance to flirt with her lover, and
the carnival mob chases old Shylock up and down the little
stairs, over the benches, round about and out one of the two
lower gates to the ring.</p>

<p>The ghost scene in <em>Hamlet</em>? Imagine the sentinel’s companions
moonlit in the center. Imagine a gallery behind the
arches lighted with a dim and ghostly radiance. And imagine
Marcellus suddenly and fearfully pointing to the figure of the
dead man where it moves above the last row of spectators. No
mixing of actors and audience, but what a thrill to see the ghost
across a gulf of turned and straining faces, what a horror to see
him over your own shoulder! Later Hamlet climbs stone by
stone to meet and speak with the ghost from a platform above
one of the great entrances.</p>

<p><em>The Jest</em>—its prison scene? A block in the middle of the
ring, a single glaring light from straight above, and the figure
of Neri chained to the block.</p>
<br>

<p class="center no-indent"><em>The Merchant of Venice</em> as it might be given in

</figcaption>
</figure>
<br>

<p><em>Masse-Mensch?</em> But a mob-play is too easy. The scene
of the defeat, for instance; light upon the steps in the middle of
the ring, workers piled up on it, messengers and refugees running
in from gate after gate, from all four entrances, flinging
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</span>themselves back on the crowd in the center as the news of fresh
disaster comes. The rattle of firearms; lights against the back
of the high gallery, and the silhouettes of a score of machine
guns trained on the actors and the audience.</p>

<p>It would be foolish to deny that the Medrano is not a theater
for every play. It could not hold some that the artificiality of
the Redoutensaal would make welcome—Oscar Wilde’s, for
instance—along with most of the conversational Realism of the
past thirty years. But it could house all that the Grosses
Schauspielhaus is fitted for—Greek tragedy and comedy,
Shakespeare’s greatest plays, dramas like <em>Florian Geyer</em>, <em>The
Weavers</em>, and <em>Danton</em>. Some of the scenes of such pieces, the
intimate episodes which Reinhardt’s circus balks at, could be
done excellently in the Medrano. It has all the intimacy of
Copeau’s theater, and it could bring into its ring many dramas
of to-day,—<em>The Emperor Jones</em>, <em>Strife</em>,—which are impossible
in the Vieux-Colombier. The Medrano has its limitations, of
course, but they are not the limitations of size, emotion, or
period. The plays that it could not do would be the plays least
worth doing, at their best the plays which give to a reader
almost all that they have to give.</p>

<p>If you should try to make a comparison of method, rather
than of limitations, between the three active presentational theaters
of Europe, and the fourth that might be, it would run, I
think something like this: The Grosses Schauspielhaus tries to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</span>
deceive you in curious ways,—with dome and scenery and cloud
machine. The Vieux-Colombier carefully explains to you that
this is a theater, and that this is also life. The Redoutensaal
asks you to dress up and see something artistic. The Medrano
unites you and overwhelms you.</p>

<p>The thing that impresses any one who studies the Medrano
from the point of view of play production—it may even impress
the reader who tries to understand and sympathize with these
attempts to suggest how plays might be produced there—is the
great variety which such a theater offers and always the sense of
unity which it creates. From every angle relationships center
upon the actor, or cut across one another as he moves about,
makes entrances or exits, or appears in the back of the audience.
All these relationships work to a fine, natural unity. There is
the actor in the center with the audience about him; there is the
actor on the rim drawing the audience out and across to him.
There are three circles of action within one another in a single
unity. And there is the sense of all this which the audience
has as it looks down, Olympian, from its banks of seats.</p>

<p>Something of the vision of the aeroplane invades the Medrano.
We see life anew. We see it cut across on a fresh
plane. Patterns appear of which we had no knowledge. Relationships
become clear that were once confusion. We catch
a sense of the roundness and rightness of life. And in the
Medrano, while we win this vision in a new dimension, we do<span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</span>
not lose the feel of the old. Such a theater establishes both for
us. It gives us the three unities of space in all their fulness.
They cut across one another like the planes of a hypercube.
And the deeper they cut, the deeper grows the unity.</p>

<p>The Medrano seems to solve two problems of the modern
theater. These arise from two desires in the leading directors
and artists. One is to throw out the actor into sharp relief,
stripped of everything but the essential in setting. This motivates
a production like <em>Masse-Mensch</em>, with black curtains blotting
out all but the center of the stage, and a theater like the
Redoutensaal, with the actor placed amidst a background of
formal and permanent beauty. The Medrano supplies a living
background, the background of the audience itself. It is the
background of life instead of death, a fulness of living things
instead of the morbid emptiness of black curtains. It is a
background more enveloping and animating than the ballroom
of Maria Theresa. It is a background that accords with every
mood, and is itself a unity.</p>

<p>The other problem is a psychological and a physical problem,
the problem of life-principles in art. In the beginning the
theater was masculine. Its essence was a thrust. The phallus
was borne in the processional ritual at the opening of the
Theater of Dionysus each spring; and its presence was significant.
The greatest and the healthiest of the theaters have always
plunged their actors into the midst of the audience. It is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</span>
only decadence, whether Roman or Victorian, that has withdrawn
the actor into a sheath, a cave, a mouth, and has tried to
drag the spirit of the spectator in with him. The peep show is
essentially evil. I will not say it is feminine, but I will say that
the art of the theater is a masculine art, that it is assertive and
not receptive. Its business is to imbue the audience. It is not
too difficult to see in the proscenium arch the reason for the
barrenness of the realistic theater. Directors and artists who
have felt this have tried to find a playhouse that lies nearer to
the masculine vigor of Æschylus and Shakespeare. I think
they can find it in the Cirque Medrano.</p>

THE OLD SPIRIT—THE NEW THEATER</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">It</span> is hard to escape the belief that this ferment in the theater
means something. Something for life and from life;
something for art and from art. Something immensely
important to the sense of godhead in man which is life and art
together, life and art fecundating one another.</p>

<p>It seems peculiarly clear that the new forces in the theater
have been working towards a spiritual change far more novel,
far more interesting, and naturally far more important than
any of the technical changes which they have brought about.</p>

<p>The technical changes have been confusing. First this business
of scenic designers and revolving stages and all manner
of show and mechanism; and now the “naked stage,” abdication
of the artist, scrapping of the machines, the actor alone,
on a podium or in a circus ring. All in the name of drama.</p>

<p>There is only one explanation. These changes have come
as part of an attempt to restore the theater to its old functions.
They are two very extraordinary functions. One may be debauched
into titillation, or may rise to that fulness of vitality,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</span>
that excitation, upon which the second function of the theater
is based, the function of exaltation.</p>

<p>Between the older theater, in which these functions worked
as potently as they worked seldom, and the theater in which
they may work again, lay the theater of Realism. It was a
product of a tremendous force, a force for evil as well as good—the
force of nineteenth century science. Science made the
theater realistic and Realism made the drama scientific. It
ceased to be a show. It became a photograph. The drama
was made “truer,” but only in the sense that a photograph may
be truer to fact than a drawing by Picasso. It achieved resemblance
to life. And then it ceased to have excitement or exaltation,
because excitement, in the vivid sense in which I use it
here, is most uncommon in modern life, and because exaltation
is a rare and hidden thing showing seldom in outward relations.
Both are too exceptional for Realism.</p>

<p>The restoration of excitement to the theater may appear to
degrade it from the exact and austere report of life which Realism
demands. But the thrill of movement and event is the
element in the theater which lifts our spirits to the point where
exaltation is possible. The power of the theater lies in just
this ability to raise us to ecstasy through the love of vitality
which is the commonest sign of divinity in life. And when
the theater gives us ecstasy, what becomes of science? And
who cares?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</span></p>

<p>The new forces in the theater have struggled more or less
blindly toward this end. They have tried beauty, richness,
novelty, to win back excitement. They have only just begun
to see that the liveliest excitation in the playhouse may come
from the art of the actor and the art of the <em>régisseur</em> when they
are stripped to the task of providing exaltation. Present the
actor as an actor, and the background as an honest, material
background, and you are ready for what glories the playwright
and the peculiar genius of the theater can provide. The drama
is free again for its eternal task—the showing of the soul of life.</p>

<p>Just how much this may mean is perhaps the test of your
belief in the theater. It is the conviction of some of us that
there has resided in the theater—and our hope that there may
reside once more—something akin to the religious spirit. A
definition of this spirit is difficult. It is certainly not religion.
It goes behind religion. It is the exaltation of which formal
creeds are a product. It is the vitality which informs life, and
begets art. Out of the intensity of spiritual feeling which
rises from the eternal processes of the universe and in turn becomes
conscious of them, the thing is born which made Greek
tragedy noble and which called drama back to life in the
Middle Ages. Then it was the spirit of religion. To-day we
might call it the spirit of life.</p>

<p>Both consciously and unconsciously men of the theater have
sought to win back this exaltation. The latest attempt is in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</span>
some ways the most daring and the most interesting. Max
Reinhardt, leaving the playhouse, has tried to find it in a wedding
of the drama and the church. Before this book is published,
Reinhardt will have produced Calderon’s mystic drama,
<em>The Theater of the World</em>, under the high altar of the Collegienkirche
in Salzburg. It is impossible now to speak of
how far he has been able to effect an esthetic union between the
handsome rococo edifice and the platform for his players; it is
only possible to speculate on the spiritual feeling which spectators
may gain through looking up at the actors from a flat
floor, instead of looking down upon them. I cannot speak of
the actual presence of exaltation in the audience, but we can
speculate together on the possibilities of winning back spiritual
vitality for the drama by union with the church.</p>

<p>First of all, there comes the disquieting thought that the
theater presents the spectacle these days of a bird that lays eggs
in another bird’s nest. It isn’t content with the one it has used
for some centuries. It must go snooping about looking for a
new haven for the drama. It tries the circus. It tries the
ballroom. It shows us the Grosses Schauspielhaus and the
Redoutensaal. It even seems to have got a notion of laying its
eggs on the fourth wall. As this was the only thing that wasn’t
thoroughly real in the realistic theater, the result—the motion
picture—is a bit of a scramble. And now the cuckoo theater
has its eye on the church.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</span></p>

<p>A truer charge might be that the human animal has a perverse
liking for novelty; but even that could be countered with
the assertion that out of the stimulation of novelty, as out of
almost any stimulation, man can make art—if he has it in him.
As to that strange bird, the theater, it has never had good home-keeping
habits. It laid its eggs on Greek altars, and in the
mangers of Christian chapels. It nested in the inn yard in
England, and the tennis court in France. The fact that the
theater has a habit of roaming is worth about as much in this
discussion of its chance in the modern church as the fact that it
once found ecstasy by the Greek altar and produced little approaching
dramatic literature while it was in the Christian
church.</p>

<p>Jacques Copeau complains that the drama has no home to-day,
and asserts that between the only choices open to it—the
church and the street—he much prefers the street. The
church doesn’t want the drama; its creed doesn’t want the
drama; its spirit repels the drama. In this relation of the
church and the theater there seems to be a problem for Europe
and a problem for America. The possibility of the two uniting
appears much greater in Europe. Europe—particularly
central and southern Europe, where Catholicism flourishes—holds
far more of genuine religious spirit than does America.
Moreover, the church there has the strength of tradition and of
art behind it. The esthetic-emotional grip of the churches<span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</span>
themselves, their architecture, their atmosphere, the sense of
continuity that lives in them, holds men and women whose
minds have rejected or ignored the authority of dogma. Even
an American cut off from the traditional side of this life would
feel a thrill in a drama in the Collegienkirche in Salzburg or
in the Cathedral of Chartres that no performance in a theater
could give him. The beauty of the ages would bless the drama
in almost any European building except a theater. But come
to America, and try to imagine <em>Everyman</em> in Trinity Church
at the head of Wall street, or <em>The Theater of the World</em> in the
Cathedral of St. John the Divine, not to bring it down to the
level of a Methodist meeting house. The theater can always
make religion more dramatic; witness the experiments of the
Reverend William Norman Guthrie and Claude Bragdon with
lighting and dance in St. Mark’s-in-the-Bouwerie. But I do
not think that any American church short of some Spanish-Indian
mission in the Southwest can make the drama more
religious.</p>

<p>For America—and, I suspect, for Europe, too—the problem
is to find a way to the religious spirit independent of the church.
It is not a question of producing plays in cathedrals, but of
producing the spirit of life in plays. It is not: Can religion
make itself theatrical? But: Can the theater make itself—in a
new sense—religious?</p>

<p>If modern life, particularly the life of America, were spiritual<span class="pagenum" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</span>
in any degree, all this would be simple. Church and theater
would both minister—as neither of them does now—to the
life of the spirit. America has no art and no religion which
can make drama religious. America does not believe, in any
deep sense. Science has shattered dogma, and formal religion
has not been able to absorb an artistic or a philosophic spirit
great enough to recreate the religious spirit in men.</p>

<p>The thing is still more difficult because there is nowhere in
this country—unless, again, it is in the Southwest—a sense
of the age-long processes of life, which are part of the soil and
which leave their mark on men and women through the physical
things that have always cradled them. In Europe even the
cities hold this ancient and natural aspect; they are shaped by
man and time, even as the fields and the hills are shaped by
time and man. These cities bask, and lie easy. There is a
sense of long, slow growth in the very stones. In America, it
is not only that our cities are new and brash. Our countryside
is the same. Even our farmhouses stick out of the land like
square boxes. As simple a house in Europe has a breadth that
reconciles it with the sweep of the fields. The American farmhouse
is symbol of our separation from the soil. We are out of
touch with the earthy vitality of life which might bring us at
least a little sense of the eternal.</p>

<p>If the man of the theater gives up the American church as a
path to the spirit of life, and if he finds no religion in modernity<span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</span>
from which to bring religion to the stage, what can he do? Is
it possible that he can create the spiritual in the people by creating
it in the theater? Can he see the vision himself; and, if he
sees it and embodies it, can it make over the people?</p>

<p>Clive Bell, writing in <em>Art</em>, has described how such artists
as William Blake and a very few others have reached the spiritual
reality of existence—the thing we should call religion—directly,
by pure intuition: “Some artists seem to have come at
it by sheer force of imagination, unaided by anything without
them; they have needed no material ladder to help them out of
matter. They have spoken with reality as mind to mind.”</p>

<p>Vision of this sort is so inordinately rare, that it seems as
though some other way must be found to open spiritual truth
to the artist of the theater. The only other way is through
the deepest understanding of life itself. What can the artist
find in American life to bring the vision? Nothing, surely, on
the surface. Our architects have reached a more noteworthy
expression than perhaps any of our painters, because they have
somehow managed to identify themselves with a spirit of affirmation
behind those industrial forms that our commercial imperialism
presents to view in our men of position like Morgan
and Ford, our periodicals like <em>The American Magazine</em> and
<em>The Saturday Evening Post</em>, our subways and our cigarette ads,
our patent medicines and our Kuppenheimer clothes.</p>

<p>The artist of the theater who is to create ecstasy by finding<span class="pagenum" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</span>
it, must see deeper than the architects behind the shams of
American life. He must grasp the Spirit of America in a sense
so extraordinary that the use we ordinarily make of that phrase
will seem impossibly and blasphemously cheap. We have hints
of what the artist must see and understand in Sandburg’s sense
of Chicago, in Vachel Lindsay’s sense of the Middle West, in
Waldo Frank’s sense of New Mexico.</p>

<p>When theatrical genius has grasped the truth of America, it
must be his business to make of himself and his theater a magnifying
glass for the rest of his fellows. What he has been able
to seize by sheer intuition, he must put in such form that
it can seize all America. It is the hope of the theater that it
can make the vision of one man become the vision of many.</p>

<p>There is no reason why a man of the theater should not have
the vision; it has come to other artists. They have been able
to transfer some share of it to the sensitive, the developed, the
intellectual. The artist of the theater can perhaps transfer it
to millions, to the uneducated and the dull, as well as to the
receptive. In the theater he has a very extraordinary instrument.
It is the art nearest to life; its material is almost life
itself. This physical identity which it has with our very existence
is the thing that can enable the artist to visualize with
amazing intensity a religious spirit of which he has sensed only
the faintest indications in life. He can create a world which
shines with exaltation and which seems—as it indeed is—a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</span>
world of reality. He can give the spirit a pervading presence
in the theater which it once had in the life of the Greeks and
of the people of the Middle Ages. And when men and women
see eternal spirit in such a form, who can say that they will not
take it to them?</p>
